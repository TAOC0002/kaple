4.500	The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rightly insists on no upper limit and a minimum of no less than 7%.	It is right in saying that the Committee on Legal Affairs continues in the refusal of a ceiling and the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be less than 7%.
3.750	The very worst situation is when the women concerned also come from distant countries, having taken the work on out of desperation because they have no other way of continuing to provide for themselves.

Since 1996, the European Parliament had decided in favour of a prohibition of the use of the bone meals in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - so only it had been listened to.
3.800	You do not even intend to incorporate it into the Treaty, evidence indeed that this text, this exercise was always destined to be laid aside.	You do not even want to incorporate into the Treaty, which shows that this text should be set aside.
3.800	That was changed in the face of criticism, especially from Ireland and France, and a different spin has now been put on it by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer: it is now being portrayed as a user charge for all, including British lorry drivers.	Faced with criticism, especially those in Ireland and France, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a new interpretation of it: it is now a tax for all users, including the British drivers of heavy goods vehicles.
4.200	And I am telling you loud and clear: Kostunica must be given his chance here and I therefore hope that he will give amnesty in the next couple of weeks or months, but meanwhile, I do want the introduction of those two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, to be accompanied by political conditions, both from a political and budgetary perspective.	And I say to you very clearly: we must give its chance Kostunica and I therefore hope that it will provide an amnesty during the weeks and months ahead; but in the meantime, I hope, however, that, politically and in terms of the budget, the political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budgetary lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.

4.000	I find it rather odd that people are already trying to tie the Commission's hands in relation to the proposal for a directive, while at the same calling on it to present a Green Paper on the current situation with regard to optional and supplementary health insurance schemes.	I find it a little strange to try now to force the Commission to a motion for a resolution and ask him at the same time to draw up a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and supplementary sickness insurance.

4.800	There is, of course, one crucial event, namely that a start has been made with category four and with looking at ways how we will deal with it, but it is not yet entirely clear whether we have managed to resolve this, partly because the Council refuses to have sufficient input in the attendant thought processes.	There is, of course, a very important point is the fact that we started in category four, with its approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to resolve the issue, not least because the Council does not wish to participate sufficiently in the reflection.

	You should check the conditions of your journal using the SHERPA/RoMEO list.	You should read the copyright transfer contract that you have signed.
	It is not completely true that failures are not published.	One of the consequences of not reporting failures is publication bias.
	I started one with that goal in mind back in high school (I'm in college now).	I have never heard of an academic journal specifically meant for high school students.
0.60	I am not aware of any university run participant pools.	At the universities I've worked in North America, human-subject studies (esp.
	Citing online articles without a clear author depends on the citation format.	There are probably several answers depending on the situation and on the standards in your field.
	http://www.higheredjobs.com They have jobs broken down by Job Category, Region, and Institution Type.	At this point I am a broken record: this is one of the situations I found myself in.
1.00	Apart from admission (which normally should not be related to age), there is something that's related to your question.	Age is not a PhD admission facor in the continental Europe, too.
	Receiving an invitation to help out at a NSF or NIH study session is highly unlikely and logistically difficult.	Reviewing grant proposals as a student is tricky, at least in some fields.
	It might be worth mentioning this while you are applying for PhD positions.	If the award is sufficiently prestigious then you should list it, otherwise you should not.
	So far, I think this is better to make a rotation of the instructor.	Aside from having common exams, one possibility is to withhold the names of the instructors until the registration is finished.
	I think it predominately depends on how you are accessing the other university's resources.	I would not explicitly acknowledge people who have helped you access papers that you don't have access to.
	Yes, high-profile journals do typically edit figures for style and consistency.	As grauwulf comments, your job is to focus on the content.
	Aeismail makes an important point about location: what's standard in Germany differs from what's standard in the US.	Like so many other matters, your location plays a role in what is considered accepted or not.
	I have been using a mode for Emacs called Org-mode to track my research and do project planning.	I highly recommend Wunderkit (recently released) and Wunderlist for organizing to-do list, and taking notes.
	What's the best way to make corrections to a published paper?	Journals oftentimes make their procedures regarding varying types of corrections available on their website (e.g., Nature).
	I recently attended the annual meetings of the European Economic Association.	One recent conference I've heard that supports such an application is Ubicomp 2012.
	If you're a first/second year grad student, go because you have to.	Let's ask another question: is there at least one good reason not to go at the seminars?
	To add to other answers: How often one publishes in the most prestigious general journals (e.g.	Another thing is (in conjunction with the number of publications) the number of coauthors, i.e.
	I think that the problem is that often many professors underestimate the PhD student's will and personal scientific aims.	One difficulty is that it's far from clear what the ideal dropout rate should be.
0.60	This post refers to research in the STEM fields, and may not be applicable to other research topics.	This is about my experience in computer engineering I found that reading for breadth was the more important approach.
	HaL (\"hyper archive en ligne\") is a French open archive repository that covers all fields.	Figshare is a rather new service (compared to ArXiv) that is just starting to gain momentum.
0.80	If you don't want to pay for Adobe Acrobat Pro, as @schultem mentions, LaTeX can do this with embedded hyperlinks.	If you don't mind hosting your files online, SlideShare is a good solution.
	I think your method (thesis title in the education section) is the standard one.	Some people publish their theses as part of a monograph series.
	I think it really depends on how long you plan to work without salary.	Why not just bring up the idea of staying in your current lab with your advisor?
	My practice is to replace the initial preprint with the postprint as soon as it is accepted.	I believe you should never include \"Submitted to Journal of Blah\"; it conveys no information and it's tacky.
	Doing outstanding research is what ultimately matters, not the rank of the university.	I don't entirely disagree with the two previous answers: taking the offer you have now may be a fine choice.
2.40	I don't think there are likely to be any standards that address this issue specifically.	You're going to find answers all over the map for this one (i.e., there probably aren't \"standards\").
	Your question likely indicates that you need to work on your communication with your advisor.	My advice: don't read everything otherwise you will never finish!
	If your paper are on arXiv you can use myarticles widget.	An even easier solution that doesn't require anything except the ability to upload a BibTeX file is Exhibit.
	I know that TikZ was mentioned already, but I think it deserve its own answer.	Mathematica is actually good for making all sorts of graphics.
	plain text/markup language For mathematics, I think TeX/LaTeX is the way to go.	binary/plain text Other things to consider (for the future) is the movement towards standard meta-data items contained with the research articles (e.g.
	I've seen three common ways of funding staff - undoubtedly there are more.	Funding for non-research positions comes from either direct or indirect sources.
1.00	My answer would be depending on which GRE are you referring to?	The problem I see with the GREs is that the scoring range is highly compressed.
	A good starting point would be to talk to your research advisor about how to handle this, and follow his/her advice.	And, as a small point, if one's work is confidential for the reason that it is so extremely useful/important/wonderful (!?!
	You could ask members of your doctoral committee to write you a letter of recommendation each.	You need to strategize with your advisor, or a trusted mentor, about this.
	You should do what makes you happy and you find interesting.	You can definitely apply in a different field than your undergraduate.
0.20	If you have access to it, you can very easily do that with Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science portal.	You can have a look at the arXiv cultoromics website at http://arxiv.culturomics.org, which however searches in articles on the arXiv.
	I did this in the earlier stages of my career, when every little bit of CV weight helped.	On the one hand, it shows that you are engaged in this necessary part of scientific research that is peer-review.
	I can also add some other pointer I've come to learn over the years on what constitutes a good reviews.	There are certain things I look for when reviewing papers that are \"show stoppers\", i.e.
	A strong factor for most people will be the financial impact, i.e.	I applied to six graduate schools in my field, and was accepted at all of them.
	I would allow rescheduling, but be sure to use a different exam.	In my school, redo exams have a maximum grade of the minimum grade to pass.
	I have frequently had to micromanage my students' presentations and writeups.	The first thing I would do is improve/repair your personal relationship with your adviser.
	I'm going to answer this question based on my understanding of copyright law in the United Kingdom.	German copyright is very different from UK or US copyright.
0.60	In general there are a number of different distinct workflows that lead to a poster.	For completeness, Apple's Pages has quite a few nice poster layouts.
	In my field a peer reviewed article counts for a lot more than a chapter in an edited book.	Like a lot of things in academia, I think this will heavily depend on what discipline you're in.
	For everything that have been reviewed AND permanently archived then the bibliography is fine.	The best practice is to include standard bibliographic information, a relatively stable hypertext link for current readers (e.g.
	Many universities have a unit devoted to providing support with grant applications.	If you are writing proposals for NSF consider volunteering as a reviewer in your discipline.
	I agree with the other answer that this is a normal occurrence.	Depending on which country you are talking about, there may be league tables for the universities in that country.
3.60	It is perfectly okay to ask for the figure knowing well that the other person may not give.	You can always ask, then it is the choice of the author to accept or not.
	There are no services to help you get that coursework accredited.	Most of the courses that I've seen explicitly state that you obtain no credit for doing the course.
	In my very personal opinion MDPI is an reputable publisher, but their journals are not first-class.	The peer review process generally differs between predatory and non predatory journals.
	I think what you are asking can be carried out using Web of Science.	Adding to Gopi's comment, here's a snapshot of Academic map at work.
	aeismail's answer points out two very important points: the deal-breakers and the PD purgatory.	Actually, I think the frame of this question isn't quite right.
	The biggest problem with such repositories is that someone has to maintain them.	If you have access to it, you can very easily do that with Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science portal.
	In general, I believe, that graduate science education is not a good choice from a purely financial standpoint.	You didn't mention if you want to do an MS in the UK or the US.
	As you do more things, you can become more selective with what you list.	First of all: note that there is a difference between an academic CV and a resume.
	I have one addendum to the great answers by F'x Pedro, and Henry.	From your description, it sounds like the problem is more likely to have been the MSc supervior than the student.
	One thing that I haven't seen mentioned yet is intellectual property rights.	Whatever you are going to do after PhD is your business.
0.20	The academic year does start around September in the USA and I think most European countries.	I would not accelerate things, to avoid getting worse grades that you want.
	A book I would recommend is Kosslyn's Graph Design for the Eye and Mind.	The preeminent author on this topic is Edward Tufte, who wrote \"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\".
	If you can re-take the GREs without undue burden -- yes, re-take them.	Many PhD programs in computer science (like my own) don't require GREs; read the application instructions carefully.
0.20	I will advise exactly the contrary of what bravo just said in another answer : go for A !	You could defer admission, but it's a little unusual to defer for a year.
	http://www.glassdoor.com/ works by getting anonymous information from users and sharing it.	I think this page has what you are looking for.
	\"All of the above\"... but maybe not wanting a book that started from a primer on Linear Algebra.	The answer can best be understood in terms of the intended goal of the researcher making the switch.
	This is such a loaded question I'm hesitant to answer.	Like @Suresh says, in the US, I would expect that the advisor-advisee relationship would be separate from enrollment in the department.
	At some universities, a Post-Doctoral Fellow is a different title than a Post-Doctoral Researcher due to federal regulations in the USA.	In addition to Suresh's answer, I'd say that a postdoc is no longer a student.
	For presentations, when you are using graphics from other papers, you refer to the paper.	There are two parts to this question: citation and copyright issues.
	Remember that Europe is a big place, comprised of lots of different countries.	There are tough (read respectable) and relatively easy (read weaker) schools and PhD programs in both sides.
	Here's an answer based on my experience in the United States.	Everywhere I've attended and worked in Britain, I've called teachers by their first name and been called my first name.
	A link to a profile page that makes it clear you're a grad student should be enough.	Personally I hate signatures, I see it as trying to make a superficial impression based on a title.
	is there a way to measure my own reviewing bias?	There aren’t many ways for your to evaluate how your reviews stand against others, but there is at least one.
	I'll tackle the easiest side of the question first: bringing nothing should not create trouble.	A gift to show your gratitude will always be appreciated.
	Applying to Masters Program does not really depend on one single factor but a variety of factors.	Yes, the acknowledgements section of your paper is an appropriate place to thank anyone who provided valuable assistance.
	I feel like pointing out that the very use of the word 'productivity' reflects a certain kind of bias towards \"quantity\".	There is no accepted numerical measure for an individual's academic productivity.
	PubMedCentral gives you full text and their API may be able to do it.	There seems to be no service or tool that let's you download articles in bulk.
	This recent Nature news item would seem to suggest rather strongly that SCIRP is not a serious outfit.	Yes, I  do indeed have some direct experience with them.
	I checked the peer review policy of Nature and Science, I guess that should is the best we can get.	Well, as you said, there is no rule that explicitly says that the information mentioned in a “invitation to review” is confidential.
	I don't know how common it is, but certainly some institutions allow student papers.	Have you tried asking your supervisor to deposit the papers?
0.00	Edit, again: The question seems to have changed, yet again.	I can think of three reasons why a faculty member might reveal how a student performed on a qualifying examination.
	True story: a bottle of wine (well, maybe just half a bottle).	Second, I try to process 10 or so exams before actually marking any of them.
	Script only the introduction I can only echo what Artem said about the disadvantages of a script.	I think a script is actually more harmful than good.
0.00	I agree with Seteropere completely, \"Network Science\" is a very broad subject.	I would say you are approaching it in the wrong way.
	I prefer to group definitions of notation and symbols with the typical \"List of ...\" elements.	Email the work to someone (or yourself) well before you hand it over.
	If you use bibtex, then you can batch edit with things like sed, awk, or simple find/replace in any text editor.	In my experience, the author syntax changes if you're using DOI or PMID.
	I think the answer to your question is very dependent on your subject and the culture of that research area.	I agree that reference formatting for a thesis tends to follow university and discipline specific guidelines.
	The first rule, as usual, is: what is expected of you?	I always view \"we\" as \"you and the reader\" and you and your reader journey through the subject together.
	I would say that it depends on the complexity you get out of it.	You should definitely consider publishing the algorithm, but not before you could say something more than merely a pseudocode.
	How many publications or conference papers would you get out of this work?	I've known of a few cases of people prolonging their Ph.Ds to improve their CVs.
1.20	Supporting an ideology in an ostentatious manner (rather than privately or discreetly) is a personality problem.	I think for an appropriate answer I'd need to know exactly what the 'bad' ideology is.
	When asking a question, it is desirable to explicitly establish a non-confrontational tone.	My personal preference is not to offer a compliment in this setting.
	I will advise exactly the contrary of what bravo just said in another answer : go for A !	For questions 1 and 2: it depends: you have to find out from your individual advisor/department/university.
	If there's a medical reason for it and the student can produce an appropriate doctor's certificate or what not.	You will definitely need to check regulations regarding the wearing of costumes that conceal one's appearance.
0.00	This does not fully answer your question, but it is certainly one consideration.	I am a PhD student in Computational Science, which is an interdisciplinary major spanning mathematics, computer science, and engineerning.
	TV-L is the German public servant remuneration grade table (Tarifvertrag für den Öffentlichen Dienst der Länder (TV-L)).	I am sure a psychologist could provide an indepth analysis to a large part of this question.
	nobody cares about your university, the only important thing at least in Europe is your CV.	Does doing a postdoc mean a commitment to an academic career?
	The biggest obstacle is that you haven't been through a Ph.D. program.	It can be very difficult to get government financing depending on where you reside.
0.40	A few possible problems: 1) Such an ID system seems a little intrusive.	In mathematics, we already have a database of this sort - two them, in fact, with in MathSciNet and Zentralblatt MATH.
	Short answer: The full name is Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, Tekhnicheskaya Kibernetika.	As others have said, not every (old) article has a DOI or a URL.
	In your case, how do you find 14 good leaders from 70 students?	My armchair researching dug up a lot of articles about this.
	It depends on whether the black hole is rotating or not.	It's complicated, and it depends on what you mean by \"black hole\".
0.40	As an complement to the other answers, let me address the question of why planets tend towards tidal locking.	The other answers here are fantastic at explaining in a technical sense.
3.00	Stars are rotating, but that's not the cause for their stability.	Stars rotate due to the angular momentum of the gas they formed from.
	Of course the apparent relative sizes of the sun and moon are coincidental.	As a matter of fact, yes, it is only a coincidence.
4.40	It indeed appears the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and The Milky Way (MW) are en route to a collision.	In a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide.
	Stellar mass black holes form from the collapse of massive stars at the end of their lives.	Stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes likely form from very different mechanisms.
	The metal content of the Solar system is completely dominated by the Sun.	The metals that are forming in the sun come from nuclear fusion.
3.20	The short answer is: we are made from the \"stuff\" contributed by many stars.	It is highly unlikely that we're made out of stuff from only one star.
3.40	All we know is this : Distant objects are receding from us at a rate proportional to their distance from us.	The expansion of space means that objects in cosmological distances are receding away from each other.
	When you sit in a car, and you suddenly brake, you feel the change in velocity.	If you're big enough and fluid enough, like an atmosphere, you would feel acceleration do to the Earth's motion.
	There is no 'still' that is not relative to some other object.	The so called expansion of the universe is not as trivial as most people think.
3.40	Like Chris said above, stars rotate to conserve their angular momentum.	Stars are rotating, but that's not the cause for their stability.
	The light will eventually reach galaxy B even though the space between them is expanding.	To answer your question: The speed of light is relative to the metric of the space itself.
3.60	According to this website the peak visible magnitude will be about 10.5 around February 2nd.	The AAVSO data seems to indicate that it might have already peaked, at around 10.5 (visual).
0.80	All of these effects are related to the 11 year solar cycle.	I will be specific to answering the part regarding the prediction of solar flares.
	Dark matter, is just a name for something we know nothing of.	Light may account for a small portion of dark matter, but it is unlikely to account for most/all of it.
	Compared to the planets the moon changes it's rise and set times very quickly.	The moon didn't abruptly change position, it is gradually and continually changing position.
0.80	We are moving \"... relative to the comoving cosmic rest frame ... at some 371 km/s towards the constellation Leo\".	There is no 'still' that is not relative to some other object.
1.00	Yes, it's true that the apparent size of the Moon is 30 arcmin.	When you gaze at the moon \"live\", you are not seeing a still image.
1.60	Let us assume the data for a globular cluster to be equivalent to that of M13.	Globular clusters occupy an interesting place in the spectrum of composite stellar systems.
	You'll probably need spectrometer data to distinguish and identify spectral lines.	No, amateur astronomy equipment is not capable of doing such an analysis.
	To complete Envite's answer, I would point that you can easily experience that irregularity yourself.	Any body with an irregular mass distribution will experience those wobblings.
	4 billion years is the same timeframe of the life remaining to our Sun.	Normally when two galaxies collide, it is the gas that interacts with each other.
	The outer shell of the star contains still a lot of hydrogen, after running out of fuel.	If something crashed into it rearranging its content a bit, could its life be extended?
1.00	Why is the speed of light 299,792,458 m/s, and not (for instance) 3,1 or 4,3 x 10^44 m/s?	Speed of light being finite is one of the fundamentals of our Universe.
	Molten Iron and hot sand - it's not easy to think of something more extreme than this.	So far, we don't have anywhere near enough detail to identify weather on planets in other star systems.
	What you're asking, basically, is whether there are any proofs for the heliocentric model of the Solar System.	According to Newton, any binary system revolves around the center of mass.
	It very much depends on where on the globe you are in terms of your latitude.	To add to TidalWave's answer, here's another way to think about it.
	Only a very small fraction of the elements in the core the supernova get converted into heavier elements.	For a star to become a nova, it needs to have a mass at least 8 times greater than our sun.
3.20	As per your definition, a star formed in a binary system (hence near some gravitating body) is a generalised planet.	The main flaw with your definition of a \"generalised planet\" would be the boundary between stars and planets.
	One additional source of evidence comes from other spiral galaxies.	In addition to @MBR's answer; there are other (less confusing) ways to represent the data.
	What you're asking, basically, is whether there are any proofs for the heliocentric model of the Solar System.	A black hole has an event horizon which 'marks the point of no return'.
	Naively, I would say that you're looking for a periodicity in the luminosity.	Any body with an irregular mass distribution will experience those wobblings.
	The energy density of the universe is quite well known.	No energy is in transit as GRBs, just like Gamma rays that started in a GRB.
	Even though I'm a professional astronomer (but not an expert on this field), I don't have a good answer.	I can't give you an explicit ant mathematical explanation but maybe this simulations give you a hint.
	Light may account for a small portion of dark matter, but it is unlikely to account for most/all of it.	In addition to @MBR's answer; there are other (less confusing) ways to represent the data.
	The mass luminosity relation is non-linear (L = M^3.5 for the main sequence) so more massive stars burn at a much faster rate.	The easiest way to think of it is terms of the cube square law coming into play.
	Well, when two black holes collide a new black hole is created.	There are currently three classifications of black hole and these are stellar, super massive and miniature.
	There is a prior answer here claiming that \"a moon with a moon would be an unstable system\".	I don't think there are any in the Solar system.
	As far as I know all accretion disks are prograde.	Consider a binary system with a neutron star and a companion star.
	From 1979 to 1999, Pluto was the eighth planet from the sun.	No, Pluto is a so called resonant trans-neptunian object; the orbital period of Pluto is almost exactly 3:2 (1.5) times that of Neptune.
2.00	A method used to calculate the distance between stars is 3 Dimensional trigonometry.	You only need two-dimensional trigonometry if you know the distances to the two stars and their angular separation.
	The light will eventually reach galaxy B even though the space between them is expanding.	To any observer between 'A' and 'B' where the light wave passes, it passes with the speed of light.
	Like Afzaal Ahmad said black holes evaporate through Hawking radiation, proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1974.	Yes, everything that is in this universe has to say Good bye to its existence.
	You're experiencing a few issues all of which have one solution.	Regarding the fact of using the scope indoors: it's understandable, but silly.
	Space, as we experience it, is simply three-dimensional Euklidean (flat) space.	Particle like, molecule or atoms or any smallest particle behaves differently in different environment.
	Stars can form in circumstellar disks, that are, in general, disks surrounding forming stars, but not in protoplanetary disks.	Yes, unless you want to get really particular with the \"protoplanetary\" part.
0.00	The farther away, the faster the galaxies move away from us.	Here is my answer to a similar question posted on the physics stack exchange website.
	The programs I am aware of that you could use do require some programming expertise to operate.	Yes, there is are two python modules called astropy, and astropysics that both claim to have spectral analysis tools.
	Main difference (beyond mass, which we can extrapolate to make giant clusters and small galaxies touch) is star age.	There are a couple of important distinctions between the two types of objects.
	No, the orbiting rocket was not visible to the naked eye.	In the protostar stage of the Sun, it was surrounded by a (spinning) gas cloud.
	From a (more) physics standpoint our acceleration on earth is basically zero from what we can feel.	When you sit in a car, and you suddenly brake, you feel the change in velocity.
	After all these astronomic answers, I will add a computer one.	Yes, it's true that the apparent size of the Moon is 30 arcmin.
	I think you mean to ask, \"What is the local sidereal time of Greenwhich?\".	Right Ascension is a celestial coordinate, not a terrestrial one.
	I believe your confusion is from combining two popular simplifications of our Universe.	The surface of the 4-dimensional ball (called 3-sphere) is a slice through the universe as a whole for a fixed cosmic time.
	Yes, we always look into the past, when looking somewhere.	I think the question is referring to situating a very large mirror in space facing earth.
	This is one of the great remaining mysteries of the universe.	In these quantum theories, forces are mediated by particles called gauge bosons.
	Yes, binary comets do exist; 8P/Tuttle is an example of one.	If the closing velocity is very low, the energy can be dissipated by the comets squishing.
	No - Distances between objects get larger, but galaxies and clusters are dominated locally by gravity.	Ummm this question made me think about a lecture from my teacher.
	Nickel plating can improve the surface, but it's not easy in detail: paper on nickel plating.	The aluminum oxide layer forms as soon as oxygen comes in contact with the mirror surface.
	The colorful patterns of gas are caused by excitation of gas atoms, e.g.	You might be interested in these two answers: How dense are nebulae?
	This has not been answered yet for sure I guess.	You are making the mistake of thinking that there was a single spot in space that everything expanded from.
	There are a few more elements which you might consider.	The tail particles from a comet are ejected, so they have a distinct velocity than that of the comet.
	Gravitational lensing is the effect that large amounts of gravity have on the path of light.	One star passes in front of another from our perspective.
	Pluto: It was disqualified as a planet because orbital dominance was not achieved in the case of Pluto.	Disclaimer: Most of what is written here is based highly on theory and speculation.
	No, not all total lunar eclipses will turn the Moon deep red.	The redness of the moon is due to Earth's atmosphere refraction of Sun rays and pollution - dust particles etc.
	What I mean to say is, how are the characteristics of event horizon related to Space-Time?	Depends on how the angular momentum (that manifests itself as Earth's rotation) would be absorbed.
	In addition to Undo's fine answer, I would like to explain a bit about the motivation behind the definition.	The correct answer is 8 (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).
	charon and pluto are tidally locked, as is the moon to the earth.	It would require a very precise trajectory for an asteroid to end up in geostationary orbit.
0.60	Stars form in star-formation regions, which itself develop from molecular clouds.	It may be possible for a solar system like ours to exist outside of a galaxy.
	If so by how much does it \"spoil\" the view of stars and galaxies etc.	It does not act as a solid lens, because it does not have a limit surface.
	Well, Kepler has explained that 2 randomly moving objects, attracted towards each other, will always form elliptical orbits.	When an object is in orbit, there are two factors at play, not just one.
	Dark matter, is just a name for something we know nothing of.	As Yashbhatt said, we can detect light: with our eyes (visible light only) and with special machines.
0.00	A black hole (briefly), is nothing more than a dead star whose mass was more than 3 solar masses.	I think you mean to ask, \"What is the local sidereal time of Greenwhich?\".
	I'm not sure I understand your question entirely, but i'll do my best to offer a decent answer.	No, it is not since Jupiter is not a star.
	Astronomers use this system simply because it is (was) convenient.	In order to know when a star will be above horizon, you'll need an equation with times, not \"celestial latitudes\".
	In the upper photosphere, the electrons join with the ions to neutralize the atom.	Emission and Absorption lines are due to Kirchhoff's Laws that explain what happens when light passes through a gas.
	Over the past 150 years, telescope technology has improved immensely, so we can now see much further than in the past.	There are a couple of different horizons you should care about.
	Temperature ($T_{eff}$) can be quite tricky to determine accurately as it interrelates to a number of other fundamental measurements.	The star reaches a critical mass and ignites, blowing away the surrounding material.
	We have not discovered every galaxy in existence, nor have we watched each to see how it is spinning.	Rotation: One of the easiest way to show that galaxies rotates are Doppler observations of atomic or molecular lines.
	Asphalt roads do a great job at heating up cities!	Actually this is one of the possible ways we have in order to make Mars friendlier to humans.
	It appears that way because there is more land reflecting sun light to your retina at the edges.	In the image you are now refering to the only significant brightness difference is between the mare and the \"highlands\".
	Molten Iron and hot sand - it's not easy to think of something more extreme than this.	I would say on the gas giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
1.40	Yes, but it does not stay in the same constellation.	Constellations are human constructs to make sense of the night sky.
	There are a few incorrect assumptions in your post, so it is difficult to answer as asked.	We DO have 2 summers and two winters - and 2 springs and autumns too.
	It depends on what you plan on using it for.	There is one rule that is generally true for all deep sky objects (nebulae, stars, galaxies,...): Aperture matters!
	yes, the equinox will drift over time, but the seasons will not invert every 13000 years.	Dates are set by progress through the currently used calendar.
2.00	Asteroids are what are called minor planets - small inner solar system rocky bodies.	The objects you are refering to are actually two different objects: asteroids and comets.
	The objects in a galaxy orbit it's center as a planet does with it's star, they keep the same distance.	Density waves cause the build up of galactic material in to spiral arms.
	Yes, stacking Barlow lenses is a common practice to effectively increase focal length by multiplying their individual focal lengths.	Kepler did know the orbital period of the Earth, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn.
	It turned out to be not real GRB event, just a false alarm.	The caption for the graph in the article linked says \"Raw Data\".
	The simple answer is yes, because magnetic fields extend to infinity.	You seriously cannot expect the sun to have a layer that would contain some of its harmful radiation.
	It may be specified from South westwards(0° to 360°), or from North eastwards and westwards(180° to -180°).	Azimuth is conventionally calculated as a degree value between 0 (inclusive) and 360 (exclusive).
	The answers provided to this question so far seem to be good.	You could confirm with taking an image of the star trails.
	Short Answer: We won't have to worry about the Galactic Empire any time soon.	As the definition says, a typeIII civilization does change the energy of the galaxy.
	As Yashbhatt said, we can detect light: with our eyes (visible light only) and with special machines.	Light may account for a small portion of dark matter, but it is unlikely to account for most/all of it.
	the composition of an exoplanet is what is being referred to when someone calls it earth-like.	The earth similarity index (ESI) is a weighted geometric mean of four similarities.
	Black holes can evaporate through a quantum process known as Hawking Radiation and that's it.	As far as we know there is nothing that can stop a black hole.
	The simple answer is (as with so much in astronomy): We Don't Know Parallel universes may or may not exist.	If they exist, they are out of anything we can ever reach.
	They don't attract gravitational force; they have mass, so they exert a gravitational influence upon other objects.	For the purposes of comparison, here's flat, Minkowski spacetime in spherical coordinates: $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\mathrm{d}t^2 + \underbrace{\mathrm{d}r^2 + r^2(\mathrm{d}\theta^2+\sin^2\theta\,\mathrm{d}\phi^2)}_\text{Euclidean 3-space}\text{.
	This discussion of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation covers most of what you are after.	Intrinsic reward is the emotional pay-off that you get by completing an activity.
	I can only think of one way to attempt to experience death.	Sort of, think of what it's like when you're asleep, not dreaming.
	Time perception is active field of study in psychology and neuroscience.	Wikipedia on time perception The Wikipedia article on \"time perception\".
2.60	Here is a lexical decision task I wrote years ago using PHP and Javascript (github link).	Just for reference, I ended up writing simple web-based lexical decision task software myself.
	Here is a way to ignite curiosity about certain objects.	Here's another approach:  Typically, we are curious about things that are deemed \"off limits,\" i.e.
	I am not an expert, but I have given this question a fair bit of thought.	I'm not a cognitive science expert, but I happen to have some experience in change management / trying to convince people.
4.20	It's pretty difficult to imagine a person with Social Anxiety Disorder being an extrovert.	On the surface, it does seem like social anxiety disorder and extroversion shouldn't both exist in the same person.
2.80	It is hard to delineate emotion completely from thoughts or sensations, because emotion can contain both.	Technically speaking, an emotion is not different from thought the way it is processed in brain, both involve neurotransmitters.
0.00	I've found an additional concept that may be related to the original question: prototype theory.	According to current models of human concept learning, the answer to your question is both.
	I just realised that I could share something more helpful and so another answer.	I'm afraid I have to disagree with Mozibur Ullah's answer.
	In addition to Mike's suggestion, see the Ratcliff diffusion model and variants thereof.	I'd suggest checking out the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (Donkin et al., 2011) model for a scenario like this.
	Scientists studying the matter generally believe multitasking, and women's superiority at it, to be a myth.	I like to think of multitasking as rapid task switching.
	Here is an interesting article on NPR about an AI version of the famous Milgram experiment (i.e.	Computers interact with you and so we treat them like other, real people.
	It could be the case that it takes time to like some thinks.	One relevant piece of research is the research on the “mere exposure” effect.
	I'm using your example, because another example would lead to a different interpretation.	I would like to add a bit of terminology to @what's answer.
	In short, there is no simple answer to your question.	No, social psychology is not a subfield of educational psychology.
	Yes -- I would look into the literature of attitude change.	I think we should first clarify the difference between simple mathematical operators and a complete formal axiomatic system.
	There's a very small percent of people who enjoy the adrenaline of mental exhaustion.	Well that looks like the behavior of any person with a strong passion and focus for his work.
	In chimpz, we see stronger chimps beating up weaker chimps that have consensual sex.	The answer has its roots in the evolution of human morality and disgust.
	Just a very brief note: in some cultures, sex does not appear to have been confined to private space.	In chimpz, we see stronger chimps beating up weaker chimps that have consensual sex.
	(2006) provide the most comprehensive overview of models in this domain.	Diederich & Busemeyer (2003) presented a diffusion model for three choice alternatives (p. 314).
	No, that is not the current model of human vision.	There is no true frame rate of the eyes, but there are limitations.
	Let me give you some background to your question first.	Most of society can't agree entirely on how to define manliness.
	It sounds like you are interested in the Spacing Effect.	The search terms \"gradual-interval recall\" may give you another area to research.
0.00	There are individuals who possess extraordinary memory ability, sometimes called eidetic memory.	There are many arguments for why this is not the case.
	Currently, no such high-level maps based directly on human cortex exist (as far as I can tell).	You might be very interested in a paper by Felleman and Van Essen (1991).
	Yes, writing increases the modality and attention given to a piece of information.	The behavioral output itself can only indirectly affect memory, but the mechanism of reinforcement lies in its reception of attention.
2.00	Spike trigger is a specific type or you could say a sub-set of reverse correlations, covariance and probabilities.	There's the naïve version of spike triggered averaging, and the sophisticated version.
0.00	As mentioned in the other comments, ANOVA is problematic when mixing types of predictor variables.	I like to think of multitasking as rapid task switching.
	In my experience, there are people who like to follow instructions and those who don't.	Multiple causes of not reading instructions As @crash notes, there are likely many explanations for not reading instructions.
	It's a little unclear to me from what you've said that your efforts are truly affecting your brother's ideas.	I would like to put an answer based on my experience in training and coaching others.
	The problem with this question is that the answer depends on your definition of psychological health.	Not entirely sure what specific stats you'd be interested in, but Wikipedia has plenty on prevalences of specific mental disorders.
2.60	Q: What is the reason for people to implicitly trust their peers in extreme (or not) situations?	One human-being reliance on other(s) awareness is defined by the level of trust between the humans.
	You think that minor changes would make the scale better (e.g., by adding/removing an item; tweaking the wording).	If you change the items in a questionnaire, you have a different questionnaire.
	The remembering of specific events is known as Episodic memory, and you can find plenty about it online.	the cognitive skills of a human population have a great variance.
	Trolling is a complex subject now under serious study in science fields (e.g.	Here is an article explaining trolling based on Sperber and Mercier's \"argumentative theory\" of human reasoning.
	Just a very brief note: in some cultures, sex does not appear to have been confined to private space.	If any one want to be treated as genius then they should roam around fools.
	The location of a sound is defined on three dimensions: distance, elevation, and azimuth.	From the physics(acoustics) perspective, the sensory input changes depending upon pitch.
	In the scene, it looks like the therapist is confronting a correctly identified repressed belief.	An addition to the other answers: We must remember that we are watching a movie.
	I don't know if this is helpful, but I would chime in as a programmer.	The problem that you are describing appears to be a problem of short-term memory.
	Sounds no more dubious than the pop-psychological view of Neandertals in general.	I don't think this is a serious scientific theory at all.
	I think a good option would be to use a general purpose language.	This is a Mac related answer - I'm sure there are equivalent applications on other platforms.
	If a problem is complex, it means that it has many components.	Is there a psychological condition which promotes literal and overly complicated thinking?
2.60	Intrinsic reward is the emotional pay-off that you get by completing an activity.	According to Frederick Herzberg's two-factor theory of motivation, intrinsic rewards are motivators (e.g.
	Kinda : p The overwhelming consensus is that it has more to do with brain/body mass ratios.	One relatively recent review on this topic is Rushton & Ankney (2009).

	Another option is to program in C/C++ using the Tscope library.	OpenSesame is a recent entry that is cross-platform and seems to promote GUI-based design while allowing customization via Python scripting.
	This question asks about Psychological journal that focuses on publishing interesting psychological datasets journals where you can publish psychological data.	The Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) provides 8000+ data sets.
	This answer is meant to add more information in addition to the one above.	Hallucinations are not necessarily present, although they use to be observed or reported.
	The question is slightly confused I feel, so I am not sure there is a good answer.	Humans actually exhibit both slow and fast learning and they have somewhat different properties.
	Henderson summarizes very well a number of approaches on human gaze control during real-world scenes and tasks.	If you are looking for a 'brain model of visual navigation', you just have to google it!
	I'm not sure the article really covers the economic aspects.	This is just the beginning of an answer, based on what I've read so far.
	I'd suggest checking out the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (Donkin et al., 2011) model for a scenario like this.	As per self-regulatory theory people can have two types of regulatory focus: promotion and prevention.
	@Jeromy Anglim: I'm actually creating a serial response time task (a widely used learning task) for the iPad now.	FingerFriendlySoft has created an app for all iOS devices (that is, iPod touch, iPhone and iPad) that is called N-back Suite.
2.60	When studying adult IQ, general adult norms are often used.	Basically, what you do is you compare each age group IQ to the standardization sample.
0.00	Some ancient historical precedent exists for preferring $10$, but also for $6$, so that's mixed support from Wikipedia on perfect numbers.	This is indeed possible, but I haven't seen it done experimentally for reasons other than feasibility.
	According with the description of Mary, I think that she would devalue her best friend.	Because Mary is in a relationship with John she likes him sexually.
	As he says, it's a \"cybernetic cycle linking the organism to its environment\".	Let's begin by being clear about terminology and what is involved in eye movements at a basic level.
	I imagine most software designed for creating psychological experiments will be able to do this.	There's a new program called \"Paradigm\" that has direct support for typed responses.
	There is a processing fluency theory that explains it quite nicely.	Indicator of genetic fitness argument There is an evolutionary psychology argument.
	I believe these two beautiful articles target just what you are looking for: Niv, Y., Joel, D., Meilijson, I., & Ruppin, E. (2008).	There's a great 2012 paper by A. Kheifets and Randy Gallistel showing a \"probability sense\" in animals.
	As a neuroscientist, I would be highly doubtful of any neuroscientific 'evidence' about this phenomenon (if it exists).	“Show me a young Conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart.
	The answer presumably depends on how you conceptualise the experience of the time traveller relative to the time travel.	This is a tricky topic and my answer will be clearly speculative.
	I can only provide a vocabulary with which someone else may answer your second question.	Angst seems to fit your first example about as well as I could imagine any one word fitting.
	If your time constraint isn't too strict, I would say its well worth it.	I would recommend the 730 pictures Geneva affective picture database (GAPED).
	Reading list As @Jeff has mentioned Tom Griffiths has several useful resources.	In the fairly recent book \"The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology\", chapter three is devoted to bayesian modeling.
	It's interesting to note that until 1973, homosexuality was classified as a paraphilia.	Both of the above answers are incorrect to some degree.
1.60	These are interesting studies, but the bottom line is: yes, environment affects cognitive abilities.	I'm not sure what you mean by cognitive capacity, but I absolutely believe that language shapes the way we think.
	I've discussed a lot of this recently on my answer to this question: Are there recent theories on physiognomy?	The research literature on stress in general and burnout in particular would be relevant.
	The conclusions drawn in Inoue & Matsuzawa's (2007) study, which seems to be available here, are suspect.	It looks like there is a developmental relationship between WM and general IQ: Fry, A. F., & Hale, S. (1996).
	This phenomena is much more common than most people realize.	Leonardo da Vinci wrote both upside down, and in a mirror image.
	It seems that it is still a matter of debate whether animals are capable of mind wandering.	im new here, so maybe i do not answer according to the rules, please tell me if so.
	There are multiple reasons why we may like or dislike certain kind of music.	Following the comments you've received, I'll add my own subjective answer in the affirmative to your first question.
	I wonder if Hungarian is particularly good in this way.	With your question you are limiting thinking to conscious and rational thought.
	Another relevant resource might be Stephen Kosslyn's Clear and to the Point.	Not surprisingly, there's a huge load of stuff you need to consider when designing things for users.
	What you're thinking of is called an Intermittent Reinforcement Schedule.	'Reinforcement' is anything that increases the chances that an organism with repeat a behavior.
	One might argue that the skill of critical thinking is the sum of the goal of higher education.	There is a classic paper by Halpern (1998) on the topic.
	It is possible that hiccups are a psychological response to excitement, stress or as a way to generate attention.	I would like to put an answer based on my experience in training and coaching others.
	If I understand you correctly, you are trying to learn about good practice in designing studies involving subjective scales?	Schwarz (1999) reviews a variety of research on frequency estimation scales.
0.00	Since this is a relatively new problem for behavioral researchers, I don't know that there is a common consensus.	I'll address just the first of your three sub-questions, the others have been answered by Chuck Sherrington.
	As I am from an education background -I can't do, so I teach.	This is actually the reason why experiments begin in ethics.
	The basic effect can be accounted for by connectionist models.	SVM training is typically done in a batch processing, and thus the order of data presentation doesn't matter.
0.60	If non-human animals do have intelligence too, why is their intelligence not as advanced as humans?	Your own theory is bad because it seems to follow from a Lamarkian interpretation of evolutionary theory.
	So your independent variable is the bug, and your dependent variable is apple size.	I encounter a lot of situations like this in personality research.
	I know 2 explanations to such seemingly irrational behaviour in cognitive science.	@OfriRaviv provided a great answer, but I thought I'd add a third alternative I am aware of for completeness.
	The cardinal diagnostic trait of \"multiple personalities,\" or dissociative identity disorder (DID), is dissociative states.	I think the difference comes down to awareness and control.
1.80	The Hare Psychopathy Checklist is often used to assess psychopathy in clinical settings.	From an article entitled Can You Call a 9-Year-Old a Psychopath?
	It sounds like you are talking about random allocation of participants to groups for the purpose of running a between-subjects experiment.	Adding to Jeromy's answer, the answer to your question would depend on what you want to study.
	Some of the experiences you are describing (e.g., psychedelic states, daydreaming and sleep) are examples of Altered States of Consciousness.	In some form yes if patient is mesmerized by visual heartbeats, acording to Sciencedaily.
	For a comprehensive review, see: Berg, D.A., Belnoue, L.,Song,H., Simon A.	Long story short: at least in facial affect perception/expression, there is not a definitive answer to this.
	From an article entitled Can You Call a 9-Year-Old a Psychopath?	The Hare Psychopathology Checklist is considered the current gold standard for measuring potential psychopathy.
	Biological Neural Networks : It refers to our brain neural activities.	Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are mathematical constructs, originally designed to approximate biological neurons.
	In the book \"Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast: The Evolutionary Origins of Belief\", Wolpert (2007) discusses the evolutionary origins of belief.	I think this is slightly tautologous, because we all turn to \"belief\" to explain the things that we don't understand.
	One could say that brain is not hardwired for abstract ideas... why?	Abstract algebra and n-dimensional space are constructs of the human mind.
	Because a majority of the people are just too plain stupid.	Background on strategy selection We could categorise using tabs as a strategy for using a browser.
	These lines seem to be anchored on non-arbitrary points, but their flatness (lack of curves/bumps) may be somewhat arbitrary.	Building off of Nick Stauner's answer, the lobes are named after the cranial bones that cover them.
	Human-computer interaction describes the creation of programs that use colors effectively.	Charles Fletcher, one of my professors as an undergraduate, studies reading comprehension.
	The number of samples that are necessary for a good parameter estimation does indeed depend on the estimation method.	In the book \"Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast: The Evolutionary Origins of Belief\", Wolpert (2007) discusses the evolutionary origins of belief.
	This seems related to the literature on multiple-cue probability learning (MCPL).	This is a bit of a tangential answer, but hopefully still useful.
	Some ancient historical precedent exists for preferring $10$, but also for $6$, so that's mixed support from Wikipedia on perfect numbers.	There are numbers - as in groups of objects - that are easily divisible so may have the appeal of symmetry.
3.80	I wrap steaks individually in freezer paper, then put them into ziploc freezer bags.	Wrap well in plastic (individually) and then put in a freezer bag.
	Do not store coffee in a refrigerator for daily use.	If you use your whole beans within a week it's probably not worth storing it in the refrigerator or freezer.
	French Toast is called Pain Perdu in French, which means reclaimed bread.	Scalloped tomatoes - a great way to use up tomatoes and old bread!
	I've got quite a few recipes that use chickpeas on my blog.	Here are some of my favorite recipes for garbanzo beans: Crispy Roasted Chickpeas - Very simple.
	You can do it sans machine, but you are limited to small batches, and it tends to form crystals.	If you want the ice to remain soft you have to stir it while freezing.
	If the alcohol isn't a problem, you could mix some Irish Whiskey with cream and sugar to approximate Bailey's.	If you're looking for alcoholic alternatives then you could use O'Mara's or some other brand (see Wikipedia for a good list).
	If I have good beef broth I'd make French Onion soup which needs a very meaty stock.	You could use it as the broth base to make a traditional minestrone.
	The syrup makes it much easier to sweeten the lemonade.	Simple Syrup is sugar that is has been dissolved in water.
	You can also try cooking the entire bird at a high temperature for a shorter time.	Use bacon to cover the breasts, and remove them for the last 15 minutes to brown them.
	When I make French Onion soup I slice my onions very thin.	I prefer chopped onions, so you know you're eating onions.
1.60	In addition to oil, make sure the grill is nice and hot before you start cooking.	I'd been using paper towels to oil the grill, and I just discovered that newspapers work a lot better.
	I compare it with several other recipes of the same, similar dish.	On top of all of this, I look for conciseness.
	Your cooking oil breaks down because of particulate that suspends in the oil as you cook in it.	Reusing your frying oil can actually add to the flavor, to a point.
3.20	The best way I have found is to soak the ears in husk for several hours before grilling.	Soak whole ears in the husk in a bowl of water.
	I scrape any crusted-on stuff (like pizza cheese) then rinse with water to get any soot off.	As long as the black stuff won't rub off on the pizza, blackness shouldn't matter.
2.60	There are actually quite a few differences between the different types of flour.	The difference is the amount of protein contained in the flour which can range from 5% to 15%.
	The best thing I've figured out about turning eggs is: do not do it too early.	First thing first, may be obvious but use a non stick pan.
	As long as there hasn't been a recent chemical, biological, or nuclear attack you should be fine.	Cinnamon is from the bark of a tree, and nutmeg is a seed.
	I use a similar recipe, unfortunately I don't remember the original source, but I've changed over time anyway.	I've only made a couple of bbq sauces, but they've always come out really well.
	I place mine in an oiled bowl, covered with a damp tea-towel on top of the heating boiler.	I just fill the sink with some hot water and slap it in there, covered by a clean towel.
	My guess is water evaporated from the coppa and the flavors got more concentrated as a result.	The microwave caused heat which released oils from the coppa's spice blend, including capsaicin.
	I haven't tried this, but I've heard summer squash makes a good substitute as well.	I managed to find this recipe, I think this is where I got the idea.
	What may be easier is to get unsweetened chocolate (Baker's is the most common brand around here).	Use a little if color's the only thing you care about.
3.00	I've never adjusted the length of time based on number of eggs.	I don't boil eggs enough to keep a feel for the timing...
	I just use a blogspot blog to post them on, works pretty well.	I use a Wiki now and used to use a phpBB forum.
	The Hairy Bikers have made a Beer Sabayon before to serve with seafood.	The beer can shouldn't be able to rise above the boiling point of the liquid inside until it is empty.
1.40	I just hold the cheese closer to the edge away from the grater.	By the wording of the question, I'm pretty sure you're using one of those pyramidal graters or a \"sheet\" grater.
	This site will convert weights to volumes, and says that you should use .53 of a US cup.	So it turns out she doesn't have any volume measurements either, other than a measuring jug.
1.60	I've stored pancakes in the freezer for over two month and not had any freezer burn.	Its going to depend on the type of packaging and also the freezer.
	I thought I hated chili growing up because my mother made it with straight kidney beans.	The beans are always my favorite part of chili and I usually use several varieties.
1.60	Break the bulb into cloves, breaking off the bottom and the dry stick that goes up the middle.	lay down a knife horizontaly on the cloves and hit it.
	A light syrup is what the pros use, so I wouldn't worry about it making anything too sweet.	The type of pan that you use to bake your sponge in can help determine how evenly it will bake.
	Keeps the Dog from stealing the meat on the grill!	Like the people say, open lid means directional heat from the coals.
	I store most of my home-made granola in Food Saver canisters.	A counter top/toaster oven can probably cover many of your needs.
	If you're cooking something that is likely to spill over, you might want to remove it.	Actually I do this, and I do it because my oven is old and tempermental.
	Yes it's possible, they just won't be nearly as fluffy and yummy.	The only way that the butter could be incorporated without creaming would be to melt it.
1.00	I managed to find this recipe, I think this is where I got the idea.	I've only made a couple of bbq sauces, but they've always come out really well.
1.80	I  believe one cannot taste the difference between minced(canned) and fresh garlic once it is cooked.	In my experience, fresh garlic is great for when you want texture, or to slow down the flavour infusion.
	Since you note that the inside was nice and juicy, I doubt that salting 30 minutes in advance was the culprit.	It sounds like you may be searing the steak for too long.
	As long as you complete the salmon's cooking in the sauce, it's fine.	Freezing kills the parasites in fish that are harmfully to humans.
	I would recommend Bottomfeeder if you're interested in this topic.	Consider the castiron stuff from Le Creuset; my father-in-law has one that's at least 50 years old and it's still going strong.
1.80	I grill salmon that I get with the skin on.	Salmon is a great choice and it's readily available pretty much everywhere.
	Throw it in the oven on about 200 F for 20 minutes or so.	Cut it up and toast to make croûtons, or crumble into bread crumbs.
	Another way to remove impurities from water is to just let it sit.	Wired Magazine had a recent guide on how to make crystal clear ice.
1.40	The recipe I work from has you put the meat in the freezer, then pan sear it.	Starting with a whole chilled piece of meat, I quickly pour boiling water over all the outside surface.
	I belive you also want to move more at the wrist than at the elbow.	Keep in mind that whipping cream or egg whites by hand may take longer than you expect.
2.60	They don't taste identical at all, and even more important, they don't smell the same.	Black pepper and white pepper are differing preparations of the fruit of the Piper nigrum plant.
	If you can figure a way to thaw them safely, I'd use frozen beer in beer bread.	I would suggest the best way is slow cold running water over the bottle in a bowl that covers it.
	First they will absorb water so the cooking will be different, if only for a reduced time.	One reason is to remove some of the indigestible complex sugars that cause gas.
	Similar to @Nick's CSA suggestion, I've got friends who formed a (sort of) food conglomerate.	Just taking the \"produce\" part of your question, what about growing your own?
	I've always cooked it on top of aluminum foil, at 350°F (~175°C) for 20 minutes.	I place the bacon in a cold oven and then turn the oven on to 400F.
2.00	This depends on the shelf life of the cultivar of tomato you purchased.	Tomatoes will last longer if kept in the fridge, but I actually recommend against keeping them there.
	I use a baking pan, and a dough recipe that results in more Sicilian type pie.	You should buy a pizza stone, but if you don't have one you can bake it directly over the grid.
	Bar Keeper's Friend in powdered form and some elbow grease will solve this problem.	This is little off the beaten path, but try a solvent gun cleaner (not oil).
	The best thing I've figured out about turning eggs is: do not do it too early.	Spraying or wiping your spatula with a little cooking spray may help you slide it under the egg.
	Agreed on the OXO Good Grips - I've purchased some for a relative with Parkinson's.	OXO Good grips, definitely Canned or pre-cut vegetables Electric can opener Really sharp knives Magic Bullet or Ninja modular food-processors.
	I don't know about \"lighter\", but one of the thing missing from what you've listed are vegetables.	Counterintuitively, substituting Canadian bacon (peameal bacon) for regular bacon will reduce the fat and calorie count.
	ClearJel is a product you may want to look at.	There are several alternatives, but the most common I know of are tapioca flour and arrowroot powder/flour.
	Since you specified the 'bbq' tag, I'm assuming you're asking about barbecue.	The secret is simple: Cook them slowly, at lower temperatures.
	I can't see any reason for the marinating itself to make any difference.	I suspect it depends what kind of cheese the whey came from.
	I don't think I've ever head of a kitchen tool like that.	If you have a local deli, it's at least worth asking to see if they'd cut your meat for you.
	I've never put oil on spaghetti's water and i've never seen anyone doing it here in Italy.	In my opinion, all else being equal, Italian style water-boiled pasta tastes bland.
	Turn your heat down and leave it on the grill longer.	Here is the method I use for turning out a perfect steak every time.
	Since we don't drink alcohol at home, I don't ever have real wine at home.	You can replace the moisture provided by wine with just about any flavorful liquid, but you won't replicate the flavor.
	Didn't wanna just add this since it's not free, but cooksillustrated.com has almost all of CI's well-tested, easy-to-follow recipes.	BBC Good Food is a great UK based recipe site.
	Just add half a teaspoon (or even less) of white sugar.	I echo the comments about sugar – but don't overdo the sugar either!
	I was taught to sift then measure, and to scrape the excess off with a knife.	As others have said, you're essentially screwed if you're using volume to measure flour.
	If you're going to use the egg yolks without freezing them you'll typically need to use them the same day.	Eggs can't read calendars and so the expiration date is only a guide.
	I don't do sourdough in warm weather, it wastes too much flour.	You just have to add more flour and water periodically so your yeast doesn't die.
	Fairly standard fonduta recipe: dice fontina and just cover with milk, leave to sit for a few hours.	Vacherin, Comté or Emmental, I wouldn't go for Gouda, it's not cheese from the fondue regions.
	For something requiring no preparation, my first choice would be Maggi Sauce, which is non-soy based.	Try some using sesame oil to go with that garlic and ginger idea.
	It's not dangerous but it significantly impacts the quality of the meat.	As the water in the muscle fibers freezes it expands and creates a mushy texture.
	Another option is to put the cream in a well-sealed jar (i.e.	Whipped cream was made for centuries before the mixer was invented.
	And of course (setting aside any actual food safety concerns), you should just trust your nose and palate.	Dried herbs really do only last around six months, certainly no longer than a year.
	Since your example is guacamole, can I very highly recommend (ta-da) Authentic Mexican, by Rick Bayless?	I think you'll need to find a good source for each type of food, unfortunately.
	There are two general approaches to making chicken juicy in the oven.	I'd baste it regularly - that's essentially what rotisserie is doing, continual basting.
	Gourmet Sleuth can help you with its advanced conversion calculators.	This site will convert weights to volumes, and says that you should use .53 of a US cup.
	Bread machines only make loaves the shape of the container.	You absolutely don't need a bread maker for good bread.
	Various references, including this one from Lantic sugar note the shelf-life of granulated white sugar as indefinite or effectively forever.	White sugar was commonly used as a preservative in the past, in much the same way as salt.
	First of all, I highly recommend you buy an Aeropress.	There was a New York Times article from 2007 on cold-brewed iced coffee.
	I've had a few Label Rouge chickens and definitely found them more tasty and richer flavored.	Flavor in most meats is generally determined by a few things.
1.00	Coagulated egg proteins in combination with gluten give baked goods the supporting structure they need.	There are basically two types of cakes: butter and sponge (or Génoise).
	The Guardian just put out a list of the \"top 50 best cookbooks of all time\".	Flour is unusually variable in how densely it will settle, so this can make a big difference for some recipes.
	I've come across two great, and very different, types of steak.	Thin layer of olive oil on the crust before you add the sauce.
	(Storage note: do not wash the bulbs before storing them; place in plastic bag in the refrigerator.	You can peel it and slice it, add some lemon and salt and eat it raw as a fresh salad.
	The meat 'is ready' when certain temperature inside it is reached.	Well, I can report that for this particular fillet, 20 minutes was probably a tad to long.
	That happened to me with margarine instead of olive oil.	I run into this problem when the probe is placed wrong.
	Dijon has a strong taste from the liquid they use in it (it's not quite vinegar, not quite wine).	So from this - http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=pdf&file=IAA2003131004234 - it sounds like they both share IgE-reactive (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E) epitopes.
	Unless you're really space limited, why not grow several varieties of peppers?	A very flexible pepper that is also good for canning is the hungarian pepper.
	There are the temperatures recommended by the USDA and then there are the temperatures recommended for taste.	I'm sorry, but cooking is not a science, though you may apply many scientific principles to it.
	You know, I'm right there with you on the sacrilege part, but nowadays I microwave pasta all the time.	All pasta needs to cook is hot water, it doesn't even have to be plentiful hot water at that.
	It actually depends on the quality of the shortening you're able to get.	Like Rowland said: use butter, and don't push it around too much.
1.40	A common one is haddock and is in season pretty much year round.	White fish are, as a rule, more delicately flavored than darker fleshed fish.
	The primary flavors of Greek meats are lemon, oregano, and olive oil.	In Greece, traditionally, they used Chicken or Goat as a white meat and lamb as a dark meat.
	A lot of Asian recipes use it as a simple form of batter.	I fold in some cornflour to the meringue when making pavlova.
	If you're in the UK Lakeland sell Stayfresh Longer bags: http://www.lakeland.co.uk/stayfresh-longer-bags/F/keyword/vegtable+bags/product/1932_1094_1092 which really work extremely well.	As for fruits (including, for example, tomatoes), ethylene gas is released by fruits and causes them to ripen.
	Use a vegetable peeler to peel of large strips of rind.	If by effective you mean which drink is more quivering, then adding the lemon zest doesn't make much difference.
	What about Tofu It's essentially the coagulated soy milk, pressed into blocsk.	Seitan is good, and very easy to make at home.
0.60	Good cheddar has little chunks of calcium lactate on/in it - could it be that?	I have two suspicions: One, you're undercooking your roux, the flour and butter mixture, and not fully incorporating the flour.
1.40	Copper can be useful for certain tasks due to the its metallic properties (heats quickly, distributes heat evenly, etc.	Probably subjective, but ... Good clad stainless steel will give you much better cooking performance per dollar than copper.
0.40	She obviously has a legit excuse, although she could have been more responsible and \"have\" told you in advance.	The first have covers both been more responsible and told you in that sentence.
1.80	In some cases the implication could even be that Tom does not love her.	There is no implication about Tom whatsoever in such a sentence.
4.00	I agree with others (and yourself) in that I have never heard this phrase in English.	I have never heard or seen the phrase you mention.
0.60	The assertion is false, at least as you've restated it here.	\"I had mainly been\" is fine, in the context you're using it.
	Usually, blue moon appears in the phrase, once in a blue moon.	A Blue moon is the second full moon in the same month.
	I would expect (and accept) native speakers of the language in question to use the foreign pronunciation of foreign words.	For words which are commonly used in English (like \"Paris\") using the foreign pronunciation is guaranteed to sound pretentious.
	It is seat, as reported in this article or this blog post.	It's \"The hottest seat\" and refers to the seat the guest(s) sit on.
2.80	I'd suggest you look to the constructions of the native language(s) of your students.	As bikeboy389 said, you can learn a lot by looking at students' native languages.
	And the Irish are the niggers of Europe, Roddy Doyle tells us.	I find the use of the word funny here in the US.
2.60	I see some references to status as uncountable as well, but that doesn't make much sense to me.	There are some cases \"status\" may be accounted of countable.
2.60	If I understand you correctly, you are looking for a hypernym of inclusion and exclusion.	Inclusion is the act of including and exclusion is the act of excluding.
	As you stated in the question, “if it were me” is more common.	It's \"if it were me\", as opposed to \"if I were it\".
	“The D Word”, in the context of an article about marriage, is divorce.	\"A sick child throws a much bigger wrench into the machinery of a factory or retail or service worker’s life.
	Most people don't know how to use whom and get it entirely wrong, but that doesn't mean it's archaic.	In my opinion, it depends entirely upon the intended audience.
0.60	Firstly, you should be aware that there are two different kinds of dashes: the en dash and the em dash.	Semicolon is used to join sentences that can stand alone, but are joined to emphasize their relationship.
	I've always understood it to be 552 (units of) horsepower, where units of is understood and rarely spoken.	Horsepowers is possible in some very limited contexts, but otherwise horsepower is standard.
	It's a joke on mistakes made with the English language by foreign countries.	It's a play on titles from self help programs which utilize ellipsis.
	Neither word is a proper noun, so technically neither should be capitalized.	If I were filling in a chart, I would certainly capitalize both words, as in \"High Cholesterol\".
	In the U.S., \"buffalo\" and \"bison\" are used interchangeably for the species Bison bison (latin name).	To my knowledge, they are all separate species within the Bovini genus.
	I think the main reason is a rhythm of pronunciation.	For one thing, \"Two Thousand\" is shorter to say than \"twenty hundred\".
	I've had people tell me I'm wrong for saying kludge, that kluge is the right pronunciation.	I always use the CLOOJ pronunciation, because that is how I've always heard it.
	I actually believe that there are some Germanic influences in the British English pronunciation of the word.	I think the variation in British usage is almost all between users, not between examples of use.
4.40	Pardon the brevity of this answer, but I would say \"named\" is preferred within the context of your example.	Named is preferred in your example, since you are formally giving a name to your method.
2.20	In standard English, I think \"don't got\" has the same register as \"ain't\".	I'd say the expression I don't got... is generally rare in spoken AmE.
	He doesn't is correct, because it is the contraction of He does not.	In most cases when this happens the person is really a non-native English speaker as you said.
	This situation, where a pronoun comes after a form of the verb \"to be\", is called a predicate nominative.	If a pronoun is the subject of a verb, then you use I.
	Irritation is relatively mild and is something you find annoying but can handle without a lot of grief.	The difference between irritate and vex is small but definite.
	I think both are technically correct, but the former sounds much better.	\"In almost all cases\" sounds better to me, as almost refers to all:  \"almost all\".
	In this particular case the correct word to use is 'less', since 'people' is a mass/collective noun.	I would say \"fewer people\"; and it is indeed linked to count vs uncount nouns.
1.00	The \"more posh\" words are usually Latin (occasionally Greek) in origin.	As Shinto pointed out, vulgar words exist in every language.
0.00	I'm American, and I've never heard the bathroom referred to as St. John's.	In situations like these, I tend to lengthen out the phrase.
	As a native speaker of American English, I'll say that it's at least not a widely used variant.	The Corpus of Contemporary American English shows 4253 occurrences of “ironic” and 134 occurrences of “ironical”, that is 32 to 1.
1.60	The room used for defecation is almost always referred to by euphemism.	I'm English, and would probably use 'toilet' most of the time, and always in the context of a private home.
	In general English disallows using two different direct possessives together in the some noun phrase.	You can use a possessive pronoun followed by a word with 's (i.e.
	I believe \"try and do\" is more of an oral expression, but has the same meaning as \"try to do\".	\"Try and\" has largely been relegated to colloquial use, and \"try to\" is generally considered the correct form.
	I don't think I have ever heard the second version in the US before.	Speaking as an Englishman: the first sounds much more natural.
	There's a lot of variation because of the specific sounds involved.	I've seen the common pronunciation change in my region (American English) in the last 20 years or so.
	To me, it's not a matter of gentleness or political correctness.	The two words are synonymous, but \"speak\" often seems to be used in a gentler way.
	I always assumed it's like the difference between \"readable\" and \"legible\".	I think eatable is more often used to mean palatable.
	I prefer engaging, although Mike's captivating is a pretty close synonym and also good.	The names for Germany in different languages are quite varied.
	In American English, the contracted form ’ve is only possible as an auxiliary verb.	Contracting the main verb in a sentence is perfectly fine.
	The best answer I have found so far is here.	The usual way is just to find the Latin root and add the suffix: quintuple, sextuple, septuple, nonuple, etc.
	A New York Times search reveals it is fairly common in the US.	Thrice is somewhat common in America, but is generally considered pretentious.
	\"Keep score\" is a (slightly) idiomatic expression that means \"keeping track of the score\".	Casual English is appropriate for a t-shirt since wearing clothing with phases on them is pretty casual.
	Shade often deals with being sheltered from the sun and does not necessarily have  strongly defined edges.	A shadow is the silhouette cast by an object that blocks a source of light.
1.80	I can only think of context using insofar as or insofar that.	The form insofar is American English; the standard form in British and other English is 'in so far'.
	If there's no conjunction at the end of the list (and / or for example), then a comma is required.	Since et cetera means \"and so forth\", your question is very nearly identical to the serial comma question.
	I believe that disk is American English whilst disc is English English.	I was on the ANSI committee that defined the 5 1/4 inch floppy specification (ANSI X3-B8) back around 1980.
	As an American English speaker, I have never heard borrow off, always borrow from.	\"Off\" generally carries the connotation of removal in American English.
	The New Oxford American Dictionary reports that Pardon my French is an informal phrase used to apologize for swearing.	There is no correct plural for the word Prius at the moment.
	It makes a bit more sense if you consider quotes that contain several sentences.	Firstly, this is only American convention — in Britain for instance you wouldn't use it (except for a few publishing houses).
	I'd leave it singular unless talking about a range such as \"0.25 - 2 miles\".	It's really not complicated or confusing if you think of it in terms of being a fraction.
	The subject of the sentence were the payments, and not the total number of payments, therefore were is correct.	Since \"payment\" is countable, I would go with \"were\" to reinforce the notion that there was more than one payment.
	\"Religious practice\" is far more common than \"religious praxis\" (500 000 vs. 15 000 results in Google).	The word praxis is definitely an extremely formal academic word.
3.80	As others have said, \"ten of six\", though not used in many English speaking areas, would be understood as 5:50.	\"Ten of six\" probably means 5:50 but I have not heard it before.
	In this case at the end is the only proper answer.	There is not really a grammatical rule that governs this as far as I know.
	As adjective, the NOAD defines yearling as having lived or existed for a year; a year old.	In the context of stackexchange, \"yearling\" could be issued 12 months from when the account was opened.
	Google found 12.900.000 (approximately) matches for benefiting , but only 1.210.000 for benefitting.	In my experience, it doesn't matter how you phrase it, as long as you remain consistent.
	We discussed this in a linguistics course I took in college.	I've never encountered anybody who thinks that \"couple\" doesn't even begin until 4!
	These terms actually have fairly precise definitions, although they're sometimes used with a bit of liberty.	I think the difference between probably and possibly is somewhat related to may and can.
	This sounds more like a cultural difference that is reflected in the usage of the language.	I've thought about your question for a while, and it seems a bit open-ended.
3.00	Certainly many usage guides have advised against use of this \"singular they\" on various \"logical\" grounds.	Second one  (for writing purpose), if I believe the \"THEY/THEIR (SINGULAR)\" article.
	I'd say the Oxford English Dictionary is the definitive British English dictionary.	Here's a pseudo-scientific, fascinating look at dictionary use by region using Google Trends.
	I'm a native English speaker (American) and have trouble with American movies.	I agree with Shinto Sherlock's answer, but I might add \"telephone conversations\" to that list as well.
	I'm a native English speaker (American) and have trouble with American movies.	I felt this way when I started to watch the The Wire, and English is my first language.
	Based on your revised question... Generally, one doesn't refer to a task as being \"due\" without including a date.	The multiple definitions of \"due\" make several of you right.
	A person would only actually say \"quote\" and \"end quote\" if they were trying to be clever or different.	When reading a book aloud for recorded books, the reader never says \"quote / unquote\".
1.40	This may be overly obvious, but in American English, saying \"you're welcome\" is certainly polite and standard.	I'm not sure how \"Not at all\" sounds in response to \"thank you\".
3.00	Back in the day, \"cable\" was used to describe communications sent abroad.	The word \"cable\" has its origins in the days of the telegraph.
0.40	Those expressions could have slightly different meanings especially when talking about finance.	I suspect the phrase originated in the habit of drawing the internet as a cloud shape on network diagrams.
	This is an example where prescriptive grammar fails us (in practice I mean).	I don't think anyone would word the sentence in the examples provided.
3.60	In the United States, jails are operated by cities and counties (or equivalent).	Jail is a municipal level, prison is on a state/federal/provincial/territory level.
	You used the generic term in your question ('I have a transaction') so use it: 'transaction'.	Maybe solvency or a related term could convey what you intend?
	All three are essentially interchangeable, but many think I believe reflects uncertainty on the part of the speaker.	When a sheriff in the deep south says, \"I reckon I'm takin' you to jail.
	I personally feel that the idea of a \"real\" version of any active language is unrealistic.	Real English, as it was known 50 years ago, is dead today.
	Detectors (and sensors) are generally rated on \"sensitivity\" and many systems allow the sensitivity setting to be set or \"tuned\".	I upvoted @hellion's \"strict\" but you might also consider stringent, vigilant, or even hyper-vigilant.
	I live in Melbourne, Australia and there's this sport called Footy which is believed to be \"the real football\"!	The name soccer is derived from Association Football in the same way that rugger is derived from Rugby Football.
	In American English, \"learned\" is the usual spelling; \"learnt\" is too rare.	Merriam-Webster marks learnt as \"chiefly British\", and Wiktionary as \"UK\", adding that learned is the \"Standard US English spelling\".
	Besides those in others' answers, there are: attorneys general, secretaries general, solicitors general, postmasters general, governors-general, etc.	Men-o’-war is a nice one: shows that irregular plurals are just as susceptible to this construction.
	This may be related to the sentence Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose by Gertrude Stein.	A good example of usage of this is when a government replaces one tax with another.
	I would use frighten when I mean something with the hint of a surprise.	The two words are synonyms and may be used interchangeably.
	I believe that \"it\" in the case of \"it's me\" or \"it's John\" is an expletive.	Shifting away from he and she in general is out of the question.
3.40	Yes, your sentence will be clearer if you write the actual word instead of the slash.	Most style guides recommend against using the slash in phrases like “X and/or Y”, as well as  “this is hard/impossible to do”.
	\"The press\" is used to describe both reporters and news outlets or media.	These days, \"press\" would have a strong traditional-media connotation, likely excluding bloggers, since new-media publishers neither own nor use industrial printing equipment.
	Since Pac-Man can run off on side and onto the other, then it's a cylinder.	A map is seen as different routes placed usually on a two-dimensional plane.
	I would advise that you should just learn by reading, especially more thoughtful and observing books, not quick and just-the-facts ones.	Simply put, a semicolon connects two complete sentences that are strongly related.
	Cant help adding James May's eminently english way of saying \"stupid\"  to this list.	Personally I think you should use whatever word you feel like using at the time.
	Looking in some dictionaries, it seems there is no such word.	I don't know of an adjective form of integrity, so I can't solve your issue directly.
	Green's Dictionary of Slang offers two possibilities, either \"sexually involved with\" or \"interfering, involved with\".	All up in is generally used to refer to someone being overly nosey, annoying or disapproving.
	I agree with @John Weldon that integrity and honesty aren't synonymous.	Dishonesty and other vices are often seen as corruptions, or shortcomings in a person's character or composition.
	One common tense I error I have noticed has to do with the verb to be.	Strictly speaking, \"might\" is the simple past tense of \"may\".
	\"Setup\" is noun, not a verb, so you wouldn't \"Setup something\".	Both \"set up something\" and \"set something up\" are perfectly correct English, as \"set up\" is a phrasal verb.
	Well, the short answer is that it does not matter.	This is a workaround to plug avalent verbs into the rigid English sentence structure.
	I believe that in case of written English, the sentence does not indicate the mood of the author.	While, as jcarmody says, fine is an adjective rather than adverb, phrases such as this are fine for informal contexts.
	It's an adjective in the sense that it modifies the meaning of the noun it applies to.	There might be a context where the definite article 'the' is used as an adjective.
	My thought is that \"purpose of\" refers to an intended function of an item.	In IPA, that's would've - /wʊdəv/ - WOULD-uhv should've - /ʃʊdəv/ - SHOULD-uhv could've - /kʊdəv/ - COULD-uhv where \"uhv\" is a schwa sound followed by a V sound.
2.80	If you understand yourself and your enemy, you will be far more likely to win any battle.	Another meaning behind this quote aside from probabilities of winning a theoretical battle is the importance of knowing/understanding others.
	It's the equivalent of debating which of color/colour is the correct spelling.	If you are used to calling it \"zed\" then I recommend that you use that in your presentation.
	I've always been told and believed that \ˈī-thər\ is the correct pronunciation, albeit both are indeed common nowadays.	The Wiktionary mentions 3 usages: 1/ (idiomatic) To give evidence regarding something; to attest for.
	Because I don't know your teacher, I can't know her motivations.	The rule is really made up to prevent primary school children splitting their sentences up randomly.
4.20	There are a lot of push up variations you can do and they all stress different muscle systems.	There are several different pushup variations out there and most of them provide a unique advantage.
4.20	You definitely do NOT want to be supporting your weight with your arms on the bike for normal riding.	No, don't support your weight on your arms Your hands simply aren't really made for supporting all that weight.
	An hour of cardio will burn more calories than an hour of weightlifting.	Any sport where you are working hard will burn calories and fat.
	High-protein diets only pose a serious health risk if you do not take in enough fat and/or carbohydrates with them.	Too much protein is excreted so there are no health risks in that respect.
	I find that compression shorts help me reduce chafing when biking.	It's the arms and sholders that cause the shirt to move and cause the chafing.
	According to research (Source), the body only needs 0.36g of protein per pound each day for maintenance.	Nick Evans to lose weight need a diet of 50% protein, 40% carbohydrates, 10% fat and a negative caloric balance.
	If you want size, you don't want to rest very long - perhaps under a minute between sets.	If you are looking to build mass, you should rest 45-60 seconds between sets of 8-12 repetitions for optimal gains.
1.80	Yes, you should stretch before running, but not the sit down and reach kind of stretching.	Neuromuscular Activation and Dynamic Stretching Here is an excellent video on a dynamic stretching routine for running.
	There can be no blanket answer to this question as there is quite a difference among available cheeses.	It's fantastically unlikely that there are any appreciable differences between the two.
	Stronglifts is a beginner program, and the heavier the lifts go, the more likely you will need to change something.	Stick with the program You're not strong enough to need to supplement your lifts.
	I've experienced that feeling before, when I was a student in college.	A possible answer is that you are not getting enough sleep.
	I was doing regular workouts 2 times a week, and am now doing Jui Jitsu 1 time a week.	I did gymnastics as a kid and tried to get back into it two years ago.
	If you're focusing on strength and mass gain, you do best by prioritizing strength and mass gain.	What you're describing is the reason many people work different muscle groups on different days.
	For SAMBO you are going to want to focus on core strength as much as possible.	Body weight squats will help with leg strength and balance.
	If you round your back when bending over and touching the ground, you're taking the hamstrings out of the equation.	It appears you are flexible enough and your hamstrings don't need additional stretching.
	I really advise you to take a look at Mark Sisson and Robb Wolf's websites.	It is absolutely impossible to target fat loss to any particular part of your body.
	Do you live in any sort of shared or communal housing (such as a college dorm)?	miernik, you say the only cohabitant in your room is mold?
1.00	I feel your pain - I absolutely pour with sweat with any vigorous exercise, even in cool conditions.	Sweat rate is sweat rate, you can't really control it.
	Start with cardio and progress to weights Start by targeting a 'moderate' heart rate to burn the fat you already have.	I agree with the previous answers about there being no way to 'target' belly fat.
	Any time you change something fundamental to your form, you will have to go through a relearning process.	The worst thing a heel can do when weightlifting is compress.
	I wear the shirts for my back, it basically gives you an extra layer of skin and huge support.	Typical compression clothing, in my experience, won't give you much direct performance benefit (running faster, lifting heavier etc).
	I would recommend doing a search on Endurance Plantet's itunes page for podcasts on Recovery, over training etc.	For recovery I would say still eat plenty of protein that will help your muscles to repair/recover.
	Sounds like you need to modify your exercise, diet and life style to get you where you want to be.	The biggest concern with any exercise program is finding something you want to stick to.
	Arguments about low-carb vs. low-calorie diets aside, going much below your recommended daily calorie intake will send your body into starvation mode.	The important aspect is that your average daily intake is about where your recommended calories are.
	Are you also tracking your body fat percentage and waist circumference?	You just started training so your weight will start increasing as you will be building muscle.
	My first thought would be that you are holding your breath.	Any time you exert yourself using strength, your heart will respond by pushing blood with more force.
	I agree with @Dave Liepman and @Fredob that yoga is a great way to keep flexible and balanced.	I try do 5-6 straight forward yoga \"sun salutations\" every morning.
	At the end of the day, sitting is still really bad for you even if you exercise later.	This page has a number of  good quality exercises for eye strain.
2.00	Running downhill is the BEST way to strengthen your quad muscles.	Additionally often people will think a downhill marathon is easier, but in fact, is often harder than an uphill marathon.
	There's a couple of things going on here, and they are both cultural and practical.	For powerlifting, record lifts are 3 or more times bodyweight, and the lifts don't really require lifting the body.
	There is a big difference in lifting for aesthetics and lifting for strength.	I think we need to distinguish between different goals here.
	The number one thing you can do is train with a coach who knows about good running form.	Assuming you are reasonably fit, the best way to improve your running technique is to run faster.
	Height and weight are one factor another is your current strength level.	When in doubt, start light and work up to heavy.
1.00	I recently stumbled on a great article that talks about protein consumption for the purposes of building muscle (recovery included).	Low reps with high weights don't add mass because the duration of the exercise is kept short.
	You want to have enough protein to protect your muscles.	No, that does not mean that you should only be eating 317 grams of food per day.
	The Nike Free 5.0 was one of the first running shoes designed to simulate barefoot running.	These maybe a little closer to barefoot than you are looking for, but Luna sandals are a good option.
	Take a look at this article on Alcohol and Nutrition Facts.	I recently started a similar training regime... and I am very fond of alcohol.
	I'm not sure about 10kg in one month, but I know of one person who added 11kg in 8 weeks.	While I'm no expert on this, there have been a couple very intriguing articles I read on this.
	I really love the New Balance MO10 (W010 for the women's model).	I made a soft moccasin and put them over my shoes.
1.60	Rotate through square, lunges and calf raises doing each until you feel a little burn.	Air squats, forward and side lunges, sprawl, wall chair, and lots and lots of jump rope.
	I use a small camel bag (not too full) for that.	I personally run with amphipod's runlite belt with or without the bottles [depends on the length of the run.
2.60	If you're doing a full body workout 6 days a week, you absolutely need the rest week.	There are both physiological and neurological reasons to build in rest.
	If you mean purely muscular fitness, I doubt it's much.	If you use relatively heavy props there will be some benefit, but IMO not really comparable to dedicated strength training.
	To get a flat chest carry out the various push ups.	Yeah, if you don't want to build muscles, then don't use them.
	It is the immune system that is responsible for inflammatory responses.	Getting proper nutrients is essential to maintaining a healthy immune system.
3.20	I've noticed a remarkable difference when I run on the treadmill vs when I run on the road.	A treadmill won't prepare you for the impact of running for real.
	You are probably lowering the barbell too high up your chest which causes your elbows to flare out.	I think there is just one advice that can be given in this case: See a doctor!
	One food that you may want to consider adding or increasing the amount you have in your diet are Avocados.	It is just as hard to gain and keep weight on, as it is to lose it.
0.40	Google search for Travel WODs has whole lots of results which you can use.	As @Sarge says, this is for a doctor to diagnose properly.
	It's unlikely that whey protein would contain a significant amount of lactose.	You lose weight because you either eat less or exercise more.
	I am 29 years old, battled being overweight for a number of years.	I recently purchased a pair of Merrell True Glove minimalist shoes.
	To further stress the muscle/muscle group, to get that final pump, to force more blood into the mucle.	It sounds like they're warming up with 15, 20, and 30, doing one work set with 40, then doing what's called a \"back-off\" set with 10.
	This is a tough question to answer and requires a lot more information about body mechanics than I have.	Movement is actually an essential part of maintenance and recovery.
	Avoid You may think that this drink is only 100 calories.	Hard to answer outside the context of your whole program.
	I would also highly recommend to add chin-ups as an additional exercise.	Given the additional information you've posted, it sounds like you are simply hitting a wall.
	Getting interested in exercising has been a life-long struggle for me as well.	I've been into running and cycling for years now and have done races and different things to motivate myself.
0.00	Since you're being kind of vague here, I can only give you a vague answer.	In general, warming up your muscles only requires performing the movement with lower weights.
	Only one way you could increase the count just try to add one count more everyday.	This summary article gives a good review of the mechanics of recovery and some plausible guidelines on training frequency.
	Rhea's covered a lot in her answer but another option is to sign up for a race.	A strong core is necessary for performing a push up with good form.
	Varying up the positive/negative tempo and time under tension will target slightly different muscle fibres and other supplementary muscles.	Doing slow pushups may help depending how much you weigh actually.
	The strength training classic \"Super Squats\" recommends a gallon a day.	The answer depends on what your overall goals are, and what you are doing with your training.
	Feedback is critical, regardless of what you're doing--photos/videos are an awesome learning tool.	Tracking your progress is one of the best ways to motivate change.
	It depends on a whole bunch of variables: age, gender, type of work.	To get a fairly exact calculation follow these steps: Step 1: Calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).
	From a weight loss perspective, the most important factor, by far, is overall caloric intake.	You might want to take a look at (and perhaps avoid) sumo wrestlers' eating/sleeping patterns.
	Is there another exercise, or group of exercises, that can replace a squat?	If she is \"terrified\" that she will tear up her knees with the squat, she very likely will.
	I found this this Website lately and I think this is great for Beginners.	Losing weight is about expending more calories than you take in.
	I have also never been able to touch my toes, not even close, even in military basic training.	There are actually quite a few studies that address this question.
	Strength work, particularly deadlifts, is very beneficial for sprinters and middle-distance runners.	In addition to my earlier answer I think one key is consistency.
	I nix the second set at 45 pounds, but do full sets of five for all my warm-ups.	I always find it more satisfying to gain, since I like to eat.
	This is how I clean my five fingers, it's my little secret and it does not smell afterwards.	I have shoes that I've worn for many years without problems.
	I think this might be off topic for F&N.	Your symptoms lead me to believe you have a very stressful day job or even life.
	A good breakfast for me can consist of a 2-3 scrambled eggs mixed with half a can (~150g) cottage cheese.	A whey protein shake would be an easy way to get protein.
	I cannot answer all but I will do what I can...	Every food we eat are digested by specific enzymes that are highly sensitive to temperature.
	Spark People has a 10-minute jump rope cardio routine that you can check out here.	I've found Pavel Tsatsouline's book The Naked Warrior to be a good source of bodyweight exercises.
0.00	First of all, as a general matter of fact you suppose to change your workout routine in every 3-4 weeks.	You can mix those, but in my experience, it will be very difficult at first.
	When I get low blood sugar levels, I get drowsy.	A free e-book gave me an answer to this a while ago.
	According to research (Source), the body only needs 0.36g of protein per pound each day for maintenance.	The information you are asking about is not well known.
	Creatine supplements can improve your ability to perform brief, intermittant, high intensity exercises.	What you're looking to do is increase your Anaerobic threshold Here's how it works.
	From what I've found so far, there is still a need for a well-rounded training regimen.	As many others have either said directly or indirectly, adding some kind of interval work will definitely help.
	I have tried for the past 6 mos and i still have a little gut.	Pulling your stomach muscles in will help keep them active.
	The most appropriate answer is to consult a physician before starting any workout program.	I would say high impact workouts like running might make them worse.
	One of the greatest things that helped my energy level was to cut caffeine.	There are many factors that contribute lack of energy, but nutrition-wise, one of the reasons is \"fast\" carbohydrates (especially sugar).
2.20	Properly executed weight training will increase, not decrease, your flexibility and mobility.	I've seen guys that are still very flexable while lifting weights.
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfvd8ZgU8rw I turned up this on a search for \"Yoga for Beginners\" on YouTube.	Video lessons contains poses and and can fast-forward video lessons directly to poses and concentrate on the exercise perfromance.
	I've been buying the DVDs and seminars of Cressey and Robertson and their friends - all functional sport trainers and rehabbers.	As to your reference to power sports, core strength should dominate all other priorities.
	Just a suggestion, but try more potassium in your diet (found in, among other things, bananas and radishes).	Cramping, especially at night, can be a response to low calcium.
	Incorporate a 10 day cycle in your lifts... that is squat every 10 days, dead every 10, ft. squat every 10.	You have several options available to you, but it does seem like you want to really slow down your deadlift.
	If you're stressed out, take a week off, of course.	What I really would recommend is to change your routine, if you have followed the same for 2 years.
	Let's take a step back and understand some basics about nutrition as it relates to exercise.	First of all, sipping protein shake does not increase muscle growth by itself.
	I am also evaluating TRX, but many of the exercises are geared to the beginner.	As a former gymnast, I recommend that you try a gymnastics gym.
	If your problem is simply fat, just regular weight loss will get you there, like md5sum said.	You cannot \"target\" an area of the body for fat loss.
	In general, your body will maintain its muscle mass with .5g of protein per pound lean body weight (i.e.	If it's a light amount of soreness, it's a good sign.
	For me, a hard, aerobic workout is by far best.	I see others recommended getting outside, I'll stay with your specifics of indoor stress and depression focus exercises.
	I really love the New Balance MO10 (W010 for the women's model).	Eat like a horse if you're focusing on strength gains First, how do you know how much is enough?
	High reps isn't the primary metabolic booster--increased muscle mass is.	There are (at least) two different ways to look at this.
	\"Normal, healthy (physically, nutritionally and mentally) individuals have little reason to worry about accidentally consuming too much water.	It's fine to skip arm specific exercises if you are already happy with how they are progressing without direct exercises.
	You need to answer that question yourself, the way to get to it is, what is your goal?	Because I'm pretty busy, I usually do weights both before and after cardio.
	The main factor holding one back is the fear response.	Let me start by saying that no amount of water will keep the doctor away.
	I went through a similar situation with my C25K back in 2009.	If you have concerns about your heart rate then I would see a doctor.
	You can read books by people who talk about it or read biographies of people who have it.	There's a nice article on developing mental toughness on Ralph Jean-Paul's blog.
1.50	I think it is still feasible to store seeds until the next year.	I haven't tried storing tomato seeds myself, but I have tried to store pepper seeds (and they are closely related).
	The simple answer is to water when the garden needs it.	It is possible to buy citrus trees with more than one variety grafted to it.
	My guess is that painting the metal would not hold up well.	I'm assuming you want to keep using these tools, and not just clean them up for display.
	You aren't feeding your plants enough during the growing season so they are slowly starving to death.	If you are living anywhere around New England it is because the temperature drops at night.
0.60	It is not recommended to use greywater on vegetables that you will eat directly.	Adding soap to water allows the water to dissolve oils.
	The Wikipedia page on Nitrogen Fixation says the nitrogen is released after the plant dies.	Yes, legumes do provide nitrogen to associated plants, through multiple mechanisms.
4.00	Yes, you can add coffee grounds with their filters to your compost pile.	Absolutely ok; we have incorporated coffee grounds into our plant food and many of those grounds included the paper filter.
	Green peppers are \"unripe\" (even though we often eat them that way).	When the peppers come to fruit, they're going to start out green.
1.80	There are no post-emergents that specifically kill crabgrass without killing lawn grass.	I brought an Ace product that kla crab grass and you can use it below 90 degrees.
	You're likely going to need to consult with two experts: An arborist and a foundation expert.	You're better off buying seeds from the rack in the front of the store.
	Cut the suckers at the lowest point to can get near the roots to control the growth of each sucker.	Plants that are thinned to 4\" can fit 9 in a square foot.
0.60	Pick them as soon as they are as ripe as you want them.	I live in Delaware and have already harvested my jalapeno and chili peppers.
	If you leave the stump to dry out it will be easier to burn.	I've chipped the main roots and stump with an axe to speed the natural decay.
	Best guess based on the video is that you have some sort of aphid.	Looking at the video, it looks like a pretty typical whitefly.
	I think there are specific types or sources of rock dust that you are referencing here, such as glacial rock.	On the off-chance that you're serious... No, we are not in danger of running out of rocks.
	I'm actually going to answer my own question, because it turned out that the answer above was not correct.	If the plant really does have Foot and Root rot, best remove it as soon as possible.
	The two insects that I know of which would do this are leaf cutter bees and flea beetles.	As they've been causing so much havoc, I've been doing more research and found out that they're not bean beetles.
	There are import restrictions in Australia (as in most countries), to avoid spreading diseases, etc.	Being in Australia, I started out with exactly the same question, xiahouzi.
	That looks like either kentucky Blue grass, maybe you installed Bluegrass sod?	If your grass looks like the below picture in summer, then you have bermuda grass.
	They are way too hot in the greenhouse: try to regulate it better and more evenly throughout the greenhouse.	If exposure to cucumber beetles is a possibility, then it may be bacterial wilt, for which there is no treatment.
	Summer is the time to remove vigorous growth and keep the tree to a manageable size.	The first question is whether the tree is worth saving.
1.60	Thistle is classified as a noxious weed in most places and must be controlled.	I've got the same problem, where there are fields of dandelions just beyond the borders of my gardens.
	I wouldn't use the compost anywhere I was going to grow food or walk barefoot, or where children might play.	If not good for compost, could it be useful anywhere else in the garden?
	No products are currently registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use as woodchuck repellents.	We struggled with groundhogs at our local community garden for several years.
	I've grown Pak Choy a few times and I get a bit of colour variation.	I had it few times, bought in a nursery, and they were exactament so.
2.40	Support is good for eggplants as the fruit may become heavy and can even break the branches.	Some support won't hurt, especially if it is a large fruited variety.
1.00	To paraphrase a common saying, \"One man's weed is another man's lawn\".	First, let me say I've no experience doing battle with Bermuda grass.
2.00	Just about anything can be grown indoors without natural sunlight.	We have quite a few people here who have grown peppers and small tomatoes indoors and in pots.
	Sounds as if you want to check the current ph of the soil itself, before amendment with your ashes.	I use liquid regent aquarium test kits to track my sail parameters.
1.60	Chances are picking the seeds once it's gone to seed isn't going to actually encourage new growth.	The longer you can leave the seed-heads on the plant the better (IMHO).
0.20	So you know, I do not have personal experience with this.	Since you've already accepted a nicely sourced answer, I'll contribute some unsubstatiated tradition (i.e.
0.20	In the past it has grown almost like a weed in our pots on our deck here in North Texas.	Additional to the other answers, basil famously doesn't like to be damp overnight.
	Eliot Coleman talks about planting multiple onions, beets, or similar other crops in the same planting hole.	You determine how many you want to put based on the germination rate.
	In Canada some areas experience snow and ice on a regular basis.	The least possible slope shall be used for any ramp.
	It's a slime mold, a weird primitive organism that has spores but isn't fungus.	I just talked to the guy that handles my lawn and he said that this is common with new mulch.
	I would pull it out of the ground and replant.	Lettuce is finicky and prone to bolt due to the heat.
	I know of someone that used oleander branches in their barbecue.	A single leaf may be lethal to a child (Shaw & Pearn, 1979).
	I found a few university studies that showed the healthiest height for most types of grass is about 3 inches.	It doesn't matter so much how often you mow, as much as how long the grass is.
	I have used it as a mulch for the path ways.	I wouldn't use the sawdust if the wood has been treated with any chemicals.
	Well, I'll make my comment an answer: Use rainwater for your plants (but please, do not drink unfiltered).	If water goes down in sometime then you don't need to do anything.
	I always do my repotting and trimming of roots and heavy pruning during the time the plant is dormant.	Every trees (though dwarf) have to be replanted during winter, when sleeping.
2.00	There is a very full description of the various types of hormone rooting compound here.	It is meant to stimulate root growth - in particular to stimulate the creation of roots.
	When taking cuttings from a plant, I try not to take more than 1/3 of the current healthy growth.	It should be safe when there is new growth from the cutting you planted.
	In this answer I went through the math on figuring out how far fish fertilizer goes.	Application is 1/2\" gallon per 1000 sq ft. 0.3 acre is 13,000 square feet For 6 1/2\" gallons of solution.
0.00	I found it difficult to mark just one answer as correct because all are.	I reccomend \"Monkey Grass\" because it is like a slow growing weed that reproduces slowly and looks nice!
3.20	Simple answer is yes, flower shoots on lettuce is a sure sign of bolting.	It appears as though it has likely started to bolt.
	You're just smelling the fresh shredded bark, it's still got the oils in it that give it \"that mulchy smell\".	Mulch is just a general term meaning materials applied to the top of the soil around plants, usually.
	I've been reading up a lot on garden railways recently.	Some mosses from outside will establish indoors in good indirect light.
1.00	Dirt can mean pretty much anything, from good to poor quality soil.	Use coco peat - It's an organic soil derived from coconut husks for garden vegetables and plants which is Eco-friendly.
	Further to my comment above, it seems the OP is looking for questions to ask.	This tree is large, of significant caliper and in a tight spot.
	You can aerate your lawn with a sturdy pitchfork (as well as weed it).	I bought the mantis tiller cultivator but to go along with it I bought the aerator and dethatcher combo.
	Contact your county's local agriculture extension that works with your land grant university.	It is entirely possible that the experts are correct and that removal is the only option.
	Unfortunately, the only effective means I've found of removing it without damaging nearby plants is pulling it up by hand.	Well, one good way to kill your lawn is to mow it extraordinarily low.
	I'm going to break with the pack here and say I don't think it's a Bradford Pear.	It looks more Bradford Pear like than cherry or crabapple.
	The reference I have says that eggplant flowers are usually self-pollinating.	This plant is called the Mass Cane or Dracaena Massangea also known as Dracaena fragrans .
	Coffee is considered a tropical plant and is not going to overwinter in the Netherlands.	Why not start seeds and grow them in a container this year?
	One option is to get a powerful jet washer and just blast water through the gaps to loosen the dirt.	Alternatively you might try throwing buckwheat seeds into the dirt areas between the rocks.
	Very good information but I'm going to add some correction after much help from reddit.	It's Peruvian daisy (Galinsoga quadriradiata), which is native to Central and South America.
	Agreeing with @bstpierre but as I find they are usually a pest (bites,etc) I put ant powder on them.	What possible harm could the presence of ants bring to your dirt?
2.00	If you can get over the \"ick factor,\" you have an easily-applied source of organic nitrogen fertilizer close at hand.	The NPK numbers on the fertilizer represents the percent, by weight, of Nitrogen, P2O5 and K2O, respectively.
	Bad smelling compost is usually a sign of too much nitrogen material in your compost.	As @bstpierre mentioned, the pile you are working with is huge and suggested making it into smaller piles.
2.40	The point of aerating your pile is to get oxygen to the microbes that break down the organic matter.	Your pile will compost without turning it, but it goes faster if you turn it.
0.00	I bought a book, which talks about this, so here's an answer to my own question.	Well I wouldn't risk it, not in a cold compost system.
	If you add enough carbon, then you can't really put too many grounds in.	Late last year (September or so) I started getting about 2 gallons a week of grounds.
	You should be able to save both the tree and the house foundation.	Fruit trees in poor health often are full of carpenter ants, which can do major damage to the house.
	It's going to depend upon the plant (weed) as to how effective tilling the soil will be.	This sounds like it could be Blackspot fungus which is brought on by overly damp or humid conditions.
	If you have open fires in your home you're likely to have a supply of kindling/starters.	I used popsicle sticks and a sharpie for plant labels this year.
	So, some design questions are: What would make a good mesh?	If you want to grow kitchen herbs look for varieties that are hearty in warm climates.
	Yes, if your lettuces are putting up a long tall central stalk and/or flowering then they have bolted.	Lettuce often runs to seed prematurely when it is stressed.
	In the Piedmont, it is best to plant fescue in the fall.	With some additional information, it appears that the salesman gave me good advice.
	You've said its on a windowsill which has full sun exposure (if there's any sun at all that is).	We don't have enough information to provide a definitive diagnosis.
	Re RoundUp - don't use Round up, if you must use a weedkiller, buy glyphosate.	Any organic gardener will tell you Round Up damages the ground.
	Something people in germany do to get rid of moles is to bury empty bottles (e.g.	You did the right thing in hiring a professional with local expertise.
	It's Euphorbia maculata (or a closely related species), commonly known as Prostrate Spurge or Spotted Spurge.	If you can put together a sufficiently large collection of vegetarians, they will take care of it.
	Here's a picture of my mint plant showing a flower (left) and most of the plant (right).	If you had more mint, I'd go with what Yoda said.
	In the fall dig the peony and the rose out.	Peonies are often shipped by nurseries as root stock, and they can be propagated from toot cuttings (which you've found!
	Lay a circle of artificial lawn in its place, then put the pool on top of that next summer.	I don't think there is a solution to \"helping the lawn recover\" because in this case it is completely dead.
	Washington state removed the restrictions on rainwater harvesting for homeowners.	In the west water rights were acquired by the states to encourage expansion westward.
	If not good for compost, could it be useful anywhere else in the garden?	I'd say it depends a bit on what will be grown later.
	I agree with the advice already given as regards outdoor plants.	Although some doubt was cast on it in an earlier question, there is the concept of \"scorching\".
	Lettuce often runs to seed prematurely when it is stressed.	It appears as though it has likely started to bolt.
	I've heard of dried blood working well as a repellent for rabbits as well as deer.	After just reading the title, I was going to suggest get a dog.
	Hang the empty seed packet over a stick shoved into the ground on the end of a row.	If you have open fires in your home you're likely to have a supply of kindling/starters.
	I have been using \"Slug Stop\" non-toxic granules for some years now, and they do the job  - and withstand heavy rain!	Save the beer and make your own traps is my suggestion.
	Fat and rotting meat are better suited to creating manure.	It will \"work\" -- after all, the city compost takes meat.
	Oregon's Agricultural Extension Service has the best Extension Service web site I've ever seen!	The links in the other answers are great starting points, but experience will be your best teacher.
	I wouldn't worry too much about what exactly you've got.	add garden lime or even gypsum, mixing it in a bit.
	I agree with winwaed - you may be watering too much.	Watering could cool temperatures - because the water is cool, and (more importantly) through evaporation.
	My decades ago hort 101 class said fertilizer is not really necessary if you use a mulching mower.	Below are a few quotes from this answer I posted here on SE.
	There's no benefit in installing it low other than that children (and small adults) will be able to reach it.	I have two and they are mounted just below my hip.
	If you are looking for a manual method try using a hoe.	Add sand, leaves, and compost and mix it around with a pitchfork.
	For #1, Its not really possible to determine the variety exactly without genetic analysis.	Are your apples particularly soft/mushy at all or are they pretty firm?
	If its just the odd weed here and there, any of the methods described in the other answers.	A preventive solution after you have weeded is to apply a polymeric sand onto the pavers.
	Separating young seedlings can be tricky because their roots tend to be quite tender and easily damaged.	Local newspapers and master gardener groups are a place to look - they may have websites of pamphlets/booklets.
	The leaves have to be jagged and \"must\" be slightly ruffled.	For many indoor tropical plants life in the office is slow death.
	Personally I don't think you can use anything better than good quality compost.	You should Google \"Back to Eden\" film and see the results from the gardener in that documentary.
	As to whether or not a fine mist spray will benefit your Japanese Maple, I can't say.	Only water high in minerals (especially sodium) can do some \"burn\" damage when watering in the heat.
1.60	Aloes, like most succulents, are very hardy and will withstand considerable neglect .	Some of the guys at my office have potted aloe plants.
	chemically, you may use a spray containing malathion @ 1% with a sticker-spreader.	You could kill it by suffocating it from light and heating it naturally.
	You only need about 4 inches of topsoil for grass to grow - with probably 6 being the optimal.	They sell artificial turf at Lowes, Home Depot, and online.
3.80	This looks a lot like an invitation to a No True Scottsman argument.	I concur with @T.E.D; the question is a \"no True Scotsman\" bar bet.
	I know this question is old, but the previous answers did not touch on truly intercontinental trade.	There is direct evidence of truly intercontinental trade dating back to approximately 1700 BC.
1.20	Some villages had histories and thus names going back to Ancient Roman times.	Many towns and villages took their name from the ruling family, the owners of the village.
	The Ruby Theatre in Chelan, Washington was built as a movie theatre by the Kingman brothers and opened in 1914.	The Elks Theatre in Middletown, Pennsylvania has been open since October 1911.
2.00	The USA is the world's strongest country because of its military force.	The United States is one of the five largest countries in the world by area.
	Frankly, this is something that could be argued either way.	My guess is that World War II accelerated Indian independence.
	Hitler wanted to expand the living space of the German people, that is, Germany proper.	In Hitler's mind, defeating the Soviet Union was the most important thing.
	The French Légion étrangère has the closest interaction between officers and soldiers that I know of.	I know that in the British armed forces there has always been a difference in equipment/clothing/food/messes between officers and enlisted men/women.
1.00	Nearly all countries grew quickly in the 1950s and 1960s for pretty much the same reasons.	The USSR growth rate during the 50's was not exceptionally high.
	For many years, the Extremadura region was the border region between Christian and Moorish Spain.	I have been travelling in Extremadura for the past 5 days.
	We should note that many of the people in these places are NOT of British ancestry.	The four nations each benefited from the Union, for the most part anyway.
	The examples from history we have are revolutions against autocratic regimes, monarchies.	Looking at China, we can see several \"revolutions\" (or attempts at them) by students.
	American Catholic and Roman Catholic are two completely different concepts.	There really aren't a lot of differences, and that's by design.
	Genocide is one of the hypotheses brought forth for the extinction of the Neanderthals, 30.000 years ago.	Arguably, the first genocide was attempted in Persia, and against the Jews, as related in the Biblical book of Esther.
	I've heard that the Jin are the first people that used cannon to defend Kaifeng when attacked by the Mongols.	From reading on Wikipedia, I found that Kaifeng was taken by the Mongols by Ogedei Khan.
	Saudi Arabia encompasses large deserts, and industrial goods have a low \"value to weight\" ratio.	Europe and East Asia didn't industrialize at the same time.
2.00	While Queen may refer to both Queen regent (sovereign) or Queen consort, the King has always been the sovereign.	There is a very good reason not to refer to the Queen's spouse as \"King\" - because they aren't the King.
0.60	To no extent at all is the wars in the middle east caused by trade making the area heterogeneous.	They had a treaty beginning in 1941, after a few skirmishes along the area in question.
	Nigel Harper has given the correct chronology for Roman land grants to soldiers.	The Roman armies of the early to mid-Republic were largely conscript based with the conscripts serving for a relatively short period.
0.00	\"What I am really looking for is an estimation of the Muslim population...\" @ThanosK and @T.E.D., an overall, general population estimation f.e.	The following is taken from my dog-eared copy of the New Penguin Atlas of Medieval History.
	The last major pagan group in Europe was the Sami in northern Scandinavia.	Las Vegas was not founded in a particularly random desert.
	See PBS.org's section on the show American Experience for this article: The Works Progress Administration (WPA).	As you know, the Federal Art Project was a part of the WPA during the Great Depression.
	The secret protocol was known to the US government as early as 24 August 1939.	Churchill was not Prime Minister when the MRP was announced or when it went into effect.
	Several reasons (my answer is based mostly on the book \"Dreadnought\" by Robert Massie).	It was a slow process but it did begin with trade, most notably Southern cotton.
	The man in the top right corner is Philip II of Macedon.	The Declaration of Independence of the USA is be a candidate.
	There was considerable political opposition to the US becoming involved in European affairs again.	Germany was not a DIRECT threat to the United States.
	Assuming this truly did happen, there are a couple of reasons that might explain why.	Saladin was an unusual man who tried to win the \"hearts and minds\" of people he conquered.
	This one could be interpreted a number of ways, and most of the interpretations could be answered with a book.	The original question relates most strongly to Weberian conceptions of class.
	I'll start with the archetypical story of the type: Troy.	The Archimedes Heat Ray seems to be a good example.
	Rommel's men were not accused of war crimes and he regularly ignored orders to execute captured Jewish soldiers and civilians.	Erwin Rommel - The Devil's General The SPIEGEL has released a good up to date point of view about NAZI Rommel (01.
0.00	In Hinduism and Buddhism there is message of peace and an encouragement to not be materialistic.	This relates to the \"discovery\" of Asian, and other non-European cultures by Americans.
3.40	I guess those are greek tickets (εισιτηριον) for excavation sites or museums.	That is indeed Greek Looks like a Ticket to a museum or field.
	In 1936 Trotsky was convicted by a Moscow court to death in absentia.	I'm not sure there's going to be a definitive source for an answer to this.
	I think a simple google search will reveal the answer.	The question makes no sense so I voted to close it.
	Re: Is there a way for countries to become legally independent without the bloodshed?	A recent example of peaceful secession is in 1991 when Eritrea became independent from Ethiopia.
	The argument for Heisenberg being intentionally incompetent is that he made two \"incorrect\" choices in which path to follow.	J. Robert Oppenheimer's biographer Ray Monk thinks that Heisenberg played no such role (perhaps he \"did\" in convenient-to-some retrospect).
2.60	These are tickets to the archaeological sites of Epidaurus (which includes the still in use theatre) and Mycenae.	I guess those are greek tickets (εισιτηριον) for excavation sites or museums.
	First of all, France's goal is not to \"undermine its relationship with Turkey\" as you have implied.	suggests this kind of things is better understood from the inside.
	It is really, really hard to assign guilt or blame like this in most wars.	I understand that writing \"any historians\" you mean \"any non-German historians\".
0.40	Looks like you've rediscovered Jaspers's concept of the Axial Age.	There was no influence from China to the culture of Greece.
	The Silk Way was not a single road, but rather a net of roads.	My family came from Western Ukraine and my grandfather attended University in Chernotsy and Vienna.
	Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations has a short section on this question.	Just to expand on the disease angle, at its height, Zambia's population was 3% European.
2.80	Yes, I can tell you from personal experience that they certainly did whistle.	It is true that bombs in World War II would make a whistling sound as they fell.
	The effects of the Cuban revolution has been wholly negative.	I'm Cuban (1984- leave cuba in 2009), and I'll try to be the most unbiased possible.
	One reason appears to be the success of (Confederate) General Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign in late spring of 1862.	It is a mistake to think of the Battle of the Wilderness as a Confederate Victory.
	There is nothing special about borders of former Russian Empire when considering Soviet expansion.	What I think happened here is a case of gradual exaggeration.
	There are many examples of propaganda in the American revolution.	The middle of the 18th century was the height of the British nationalist movement.
2.00	By the time that Qin had totally collapsed, Xiang Yu was China's hegemon.	The Han Dynasty came after the Qin Dyansty, after the government under Shi Huang Di collapsed.
	Michael's answer is a very good one but I'd like to add a couple of details.	I believe this question puts the cart before the horse.
	The British tried a large scale amphibious landing during WW1 (1915) at Galipoli.	Britain didn't use their navy because ships don't work on land.

	Religions are cultural concepts, they evolve through the time, adapting some ideas from others, providing some new ones, etc.	It is a shadow to show the vertical displacement of the Grand Gallery.
	The US government alleges that this has occurred - see Superdollars.	During the American Civil War, the Union attacked the Confederacy in this fashion.
	To a certain extent there's a wider question to ask - why did German armies fight so well in WW2?	To my impression this reflects systematic bias of the sources you use, possibly, sources circulating in your country and/or language.
1.40	\"The grass family is one of the most widely distributed and abundant groups of plants on Earth.	As noted on the Wiki page, grass seed was imported to the new world to improve pasturage for livestock.
	The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has a great page on this exact topic.	There is yet another reason why the male nude was common in Greece.
	The main trade in the Caribbean in the 16th and 17th centuries was the sugar trade.	France and Britain didn't focus much on South America because it wasn't really valuable territory.
	Economic motives: Many people saw colonies as markets for their finished products, and suppliers for their raw goods.	Note: this is an opinion question (especially the second part) and probably off-topic here.
	By this time, consul is more a status title than any position giving political authority.	The Cold War was the standoff between the Capitalistic USA and Communistic USSR.
	Manned exploration of the Moon has an aspect that is now seldom remembered, but was pretty obvious at the time.	The outcome of the Cold War would likely not have been different if the \"Space Race\" did not occur.
	There are several safeguards against the Chancellor - or any other part of the government - acquiring too great powers.	I can offer some points of the constitution that I remebember beeing implemented esp.
	These are early model Stahlhelm (shape changed over time, see Yannis' comment) from WW1.	The Daily Express just took the caption from Getty Images without substantial modification.
	This is a very hard question to answer, and it's a hard question to even define!	Hitler was atheist, church was only an instrument for him.
	Japan was interested in extending its influence in Asia and for that it had to confront either USSR or USA.	They had a treaty beginning in 1941, after a few skirmishes along the area in question.
	Attempts to produce quantitative history, ie cliometrics within Economic history; may make more computationally intensive demands than traditional text interpretation.	I'll separate my answer into two: ancient history and modern history.
	Photography was in use by many artists from the Impressionists onwards, many used photographs as a basis for their paintings.	I did some more research using the answers provided as a guide, particularly about the Daguerreotype.
	I'm not saying this is The Truth®, but here's the argument typically given for the Ancient Romans you mentioned.	Let's consider a well documented journey by Napoleon in 1809, a mere 40 years later.
	Ivan IV the Terrible of Russia had put another man, Simeon Bekbulatovich to the throne and retired to a monastery.	You may consider emperor Justin II who resigned due to progressing insanity.
	Time and again India has seen some reformers who revolutionize the thoughts of the masses.	This is a simple question, it's because Hindusim is not a religion at all.
	I think the main reasons are demolition of Takshashila and Nalanda universities.	Personally, I don't think anything ever went particularly \"wrong\" with India.
	Wunderwaffe (literally, wonder weapons) - absolutely, they had many, many designs under way.	German physicist tried to build an atomic bomb, at least there were experiments.
	Fredericksburg is directly North of Richmond on the direct road to Washington.	One reason appears to be the success of (Confederate) General Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign in late spring of 1862.
	I would suggest reading Chapter 4 of the book Hidden Horizons.	The main problem here is that the civilizations of India were almost completely illiterate before the Aryan movements.
	Germany, was, without doubt, defeated, even though the siutation of the Armistice allowed the impression to develop that it wasn't.	I don't think it is possible to idenitify a single point in history as beginning the \"slope toward the end\".
	The USA had won the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in any military sense.	It's still possible for an invaded people to lose if the odds are TOO overwhelming.
	From a military perspective, an \"all out war\" deep into enemy territory without any logistics is a rare occasion.	Sherman's \"March to the Sea\" hurt the CSA's economy and helped to end the war.
	At the moment of his election (1641), it seems that Mazarin was in minor orders - so called \"lay cardinal\".	According to Cardinal Richelieu's Wikipedia page he was a cardinal priest until December 4, 1642, the day of his death.
	There was actually a trade route through Ukraine - \"из варяг в греки\" - that is \"From Varangians to the Greeks\".	In those days, most of the people of the \"Ukraine\" lived in the western part of the province (around Kiev).
	This is a very simplified example but hopefully it will help: Assume that there are 10 nobles and 100 workers.	Just to expand on the disease angle, at its height, Zambia's population was 3% European.
	Languages are not static things; they evolve with the times and the needs of the users.	The question makes no sense so I voted to close it.
1.20	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Delhi#Early_history shows that the city was called Delhi (or Dilli) at least since the 12/13th century.	I am not exactly sure but I remember the media (in India) addressing Delhi as \"HASTHINA\".
	Let's do the math: 100,000 mounted archers * 4 horses each * 10 kg/day * 250 days/campaign = 1,000,000,000 kg of forage required each campaign.	This is not really an answer to your question, but the following numbers look much more realistic.
	Actually most of the defence force was successfully evacuated, not surrendered.	If the Commonwealth \"surrendered prematurely at Crete,\" it was in the fighting around the Maleme airfield.
	I think this question presumes far to much determinism on the part of the \"Great Purge\" process.	Apart from advocating scientific management, Gastev was a proletariat smithy(kuznitsa) poet.
	You can get a breakdown of the major causes of death here.	Bruce Catton's history and Shelby Foote's history should have the details.
	For Mongols specifically, it was in part their unparallelled-till-20th-century tactical flexibility.	You might also ask why these people from the steppes also created so much havoc in CHINA.
	Encouraged by the kind words about my comment, I have turned it into an answer with more details and sources.	The truth is that Germany ways de-facto the leader in the majority of sciences from the end of XIX century.
	Here are some rough specs for common planes (as I said in the comment, the endurance depends on various factors).	All depends on the aircraft, development went very quickly during WW1.
	Yes, SU did its best to make sure that its satellites were controlled as tightly as possible.	This is unfortunately the only source I could find which describes COMECON's imperialist tendencies in great detail.
2.20	Dominus, plural Domini, in ancient Rome, “master,” or “owner,” particularly of slaves.	A greek-speaking slave (δούλος, doulos) I think would call his master κύριος (translit: kurios; lord, master, sir; vocative form: κύριε).
	Every 1000 years or so you can expect a large \"1000-year-flood\" near large rivers.	I think the question totally glosses over the fact that \"East Pakistan\" was created out of the partition of Bengal.
	Germany was fortunate to have a large batch of officers born in the 1890s.	To my impression this reflects systematic bias of the sources you use, possibly, sources circulating in your country and/or language.
0.60	The bulk of India then was not controlled by Porus, but by the Nanda dynasty, centered at Pataliputra.	I believe Alexander lost heart after his horse, Bucephelus, died from a wound received in the battle against Porus.
	I agree with the New World statement, classes are something inherited from kingships, Like the nobility is the highest class.	Even if somebody can rise to height, does not make a society classless.
	Song of Solomon (as you mentioned in your comments) does have some erotic contents.	Romance is hardly a western construct; it's universal among all humans.
	The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in the late 20th century has its roots in the \"Great Game\" of the 19th century.	I think everyone who has posted here (@ihtkwot, @mgb, @Russell) have all brought up important points.
	There is evidence of English longbows shooting farther than 250 yards, particularly at Crecy, where the longer bowshots were around 300 yards.	Too many factors at work to really say 'a bow has a range of X'.
	It did exist but no one is sure what it was.	It was pitch/tar and oil that was ignited and sprayed if my memory serves me correctly.
2.60	Yes, this is true and yes, in most cases indefinite articles indeed developed from numerals, as @MGN already said.	Indefinite articles developed from numerals, and the definite articles developed from demonstratives.
	The Hawaiian language has seen a big revival in the past 20-30 years.	Sanskrit has been a subject of revival efforts since the 1908s in various villages in India.
	I'll also throw in that some languages also have grammatical gender in their verbs.	Romance languages have (generally speaking) three classes of verbs, inherited from Latin.
3.00	Preserving grammaticality and preserving meaning of the sentence are two different things.	In fact, you can remove pretty much and preserve grammaticality if you don't care about preserving meaning.
	Let's say that a future participle is a non-finite form of a verb which is marked for future tense.	Latin forms the future participle of most verbs (futurus, moriturus), Russian only form the verb to be (будущий).
2.20	In some nowadays Indo-European languages you can still see rests of base-20 numeral systems.	Modern Englishes, and many other well-known languages, use base 10 (ie decimal) systems of numerals.
	Just to add this: what is usually called Hebrew script was in fact borrowed from Aramaic.	The source for this is in a book called The Coming Revolution by Zamir Cohen.
	I'm going to answer about just the words for \"pineapple\".	@Joe has covered words for \"pineapple\", so here's some info on words for \"banana\".
	Only to the degree that all Slavic languages are somewhat mutually intelligible.	Bluntly, Slovak and Slovenian have nothing in common other than being both Slavic languages.
	Language can \"improve\" over time as well as \"just changing\".	\"Are modern languages in any non-arbitrary way superior to ancient languages, e.g.
	Well there aren't phonemes in signed languages because phonemes are specifically sounds.	Historically, signed phonemes were considered to fall into 4 (or 5 depending on who you ask) categories that are sometimes called parameters.
	The classical, pure versions of Mesoamerican languages used for the most part a base-20 system.	Modern Englishes, and many other well-known languages, use base 10 (ie decimal) systems of numerals.
	No, this is not the only example of a language that was developed de novo.	There is also the Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language, which developed under similar circumstances (isolated deaf community) in the south of Israel.
	Partially, it depends on how you think of what the goal of Linguistics is.	Broadly speaking, there is a linguistic continuum across Northern India.
	I disagree partly with this answer claiming that 'aa' and 'ağ' are identical.	I am a native turkish speaker living in İstanbul, 30 years old.
	I have not heard of a language that lacks numbers entirely, and doubt one exists (happy to see proof though).	Would you count a language that has lost most of its (original) number system?
	As many pointed out, 'free word order' is a complete misnomer.	Thank you all for giving examples of word order in your mother language.
1.80	The difficulty arises not from the various linguistic properties of the language pair as many here suggest.	It depends on generally syntactic structure of two languages and -yes- some pragmatic issues.
	The question can be explored in terms of N-ellipsis (noun ellipsis, also known as NP-ellipsis).	I agree with Thomas that the situation in English and in German is not the same.
	Regarding Romanian's history: it's a member of the Eastern Romance (sensu strictu) subfamily or the \"Vlach\" languages.	One possibility is because of its relative isolation from the other Latin-based languages.
	Matt Davis provides a useful summary related to this meme.	I couldn't read the first and not the second much either.
	To begin with, the Chinese phoneme is not exactly sh but it sounds more like k in Swedish käften.	This word can well be connected with its Chinese counterpart.
	That's actually a diagnostic test for what is a \"Proper Noun\" in English-- it resists taking an article.	I'm not an expert, but in my experience this is common in Galician and Spanish.
	The picture of the synthesis degree is not very clear in many languages.	For those unsure of terminology, \"analytic\" refers to how many morphemes group together to make a word.
	I say option D. When in doubt, you can try what Web browsers do.	TL;DR: Option D is the answer, and Option E may be an answer with minor corrections.
	There are curious adjunct uses of \"of-phrases\" as in \"a man of honor\", which correspond to the Latin genitive of description.	Here are some cases where an adjunct (always locative) comes before the \"of\" complement.
	What the hearer perceives must clearly be called a phoneme.	I am not sure if there is a word for no.
	Is your question about an analysis or about automated parsing?	As Ivan writes, the example in the question is indeed an example of so-called right node raising (RNR).
	Remember that the intersection of the outputs of two context-free languages is not necessarily context free.	weak context-freeness: can the language be analyzed by a CF grammar at all?
0.60	In English, certainly the most common use of do is Do-Support.	In traditional grammar, the word doing is a participle in all your examples.
0.00	A caveat: I'm experiencing the tail end of a three day migraine.	I agree with the commentators that your question is a little confusing.
	A long time ago, LanguageTool used to be usable with just OpenOffice.	You may want to have a look at OpenNLP http://opennlp.apache.org/.
	This issue is discussed in some detail in this paper by the late, great linguist Larry Trask.	Although it is a strong tendency it is still only a tendency.
1.60	The reason for this is that Russian is a much more tonal language than English.	Although I am quite fluent in Russian, I wouldn't say English sound particularly 'cold' to me.
0.80	Palatalisation of /k/ before front vowels happens all over the place: Russian, Greek, Turkish, Persian etc.	Sinhala, one of the languages spoken in Sri Lanka has a four way deixis system.
0.20	All the same methods of analysis that are used with spoken languages apply successfully to signed languages.	One idea that's been going around at least since the 80s is that you can distinguish between Holds and Moves.
1.00	Newspeak, a \"deliberately impoverished\" language designed to prevent people from communicating and thinking about subversive ideas.	Every language is permeated by the cultural values in which it is immersed.
	The dirty little secret of English is that syllable boundaries mostly do not matter (unlike other languages).	Unfortunately, there is no straightforward syllabification method that is accepted by a majority of linguists.
	Well since your question contains nothing to compare to and is therefore ambiguous, the answer could only be yes.	The more languages you know, the easier it generally is to learn new ones.
	Contrary to some of the other answerers, I do think \"intuition blurring\" is a real thing.	Languages can often be distinguished based on prosodic information alone.
	Perhaps you could start by studying how you pronounce English /w/, which consists of simultaneous labial and velar approximation.	Try looking in a mirror into your mouth while producing some words like \"fill feel hello ladle larry bottle etc\".
2.80	In Russian, for example, animacy is not clear-cut in the distinction animate/inanimate.	As in Russian, Polish marks animate masculine nouns by having a genitive-accusative vs. the nominative-accusative of inanimate masculines.
0.60	As you can see from this map on the Wals.info site, there are many.	This is an example I always find is helpful for first year.
	One interesting source of information comes from what old prescriptive grammarians found to gripe about.	No, It doesn't make sense for exactly the reasons you posited.
	If you want a very quick and simple program to slow down a sound file of speech, use VLC Player.	Free software, 'Audacity', can apply and preserve, as well as infinitely undo, many useful transformations in any selections of the audio.
	There's a lot of types of signed languages (some more like sign vocabularies), so not all have the same properties.	The biggest problem with signing is that  you can't talk to a person without first getting their attention.
	Sounds like you have a great idea for developing linguistics software!	To some extent, there are rules you can apply to pronounce, say, teaching based on the known pronunciation of teach.
	With some help from Rocío, I have found a fairly useful resource (in the bibliography of Greenberg).	When writing my dissertation about Language and Identity I found these two references: Bugarski, R. (1997).
	It sounds like what you are really looking for is linguistic evidence of a Semitic substrate in Old English.	The Balkan sprachbund is a group of languages which have interspersed grammatical features among each other.
	Another example of the same combination of gnarly syllable structure and tone is Tlingit, where words like [tʃχánkʼ] ‘grandkid’ and [ɬʔùɬ.tʃí.nì] ‘vest’ occur.	I think that the basic observation about agglutinative languages generally not having complex tonal systems is pretty well upheld.
	It actually has nothing to do with a phonological rule, per se.	I doubt the explanations given elsewhere in this thread very much.
	English spelling did deteriorate, due to almost abruptive historical changes.	Language can \"improve\" over time as well as \"just changing\".
	It is, however, main-stream Indo-Europeanist theory that the suffix * -es marks both the genitive singular and the nominative plural m/f in proto-Indo-European.	There is a paper by Pavel Caha on Lingbuzz that addresses this exact question.
2.80	Zipf’s law, as I understand it, is not really about languages, but about statistics and probability.	As with all natural laws, Zipf's law is an approximation.
	Palatalisation of /k/ before front vowels happens all over the place: Russian, Greek, Turkish, Persian etc.	The same goes for [g] : [ǵ] and [l] : [ĺ], and no other consonant.
	I may be missing something but isn't this more a question of negation scope.	I do not know that I have a proper answer, but I would like to summarize my findings.
	I think there is a need for a comprehensive review of the origins of the features of Indian Linguistic Area.	I wouldn't hundred percent subscribe to Tamil (refering here to classical Tamil Sangam poetry) being mora-timed.
	In speech, of course, rhythm and intonation would probably make it clear what the speaker meant.	I have probably turned myself into a machine, but the sentences I was driving against the traffic towards London.
	If you want to go in depth, check the links.	There are formalized dependency-based grammars, such as Meaning-Text Theory or Functional Generative Description.
	The modern Moscow school asserts that PIE was predated by Proto-Eurasiatic.	The answer is that we do not know (and possibly never will).
	I agree completely with the comment by @Alenanno, Jun 29 at 15:07.	Although I am quite fluent in Russian, I wouldn't say English sound particularly 'cold' to me.
	The example of Piraha shows that Chomsky's basic claim about language is incorrect, and that's it.	A sort of squabble played out a few years ago on the pages of Language.
	There is at least one case I can think of in English similar to this.	Latin has a pretty large class of nouns like these, which are actually called abundantia in the grammatical tradition.
	One powerful husband and wife couple had created an organization before Interlingua was formalized.	First of all, this goal is seen as somewhat utopic today.
	The Japanese case marker =ga (a post-clitic), was not originally a subject marker.	First, I am going to address Tangurena's answer (I don't have enough reputation to add a comment).
	Wikipedia's page on lenition seems to suggest that a /t/ -> /θ/ change can actually come from a /t/ -> /tθ/ (affrication) -> /θ/ (spiratization) change.	I would really give not an answer but somewhat refusal for the question (despite the question is really good).
	Most English words have roots in Indo-European, either through original Germanic or through borrowed Latin, French, or Greek words.	As you can probably guess, there are several ways to determine the etymology of words.
	I'm afraid this is wishful thinking on the part of some instructor.	As others have pointed out, it seems that you probably meant to discuss homo*phones*, and I'll proceed on that assumption.
	In Witness for the Defense, Elizabeth Loftus describes how police questioning can influence witnesses into recalling events that never happened.	The most interesting research is experimental work on grammatical gender and functional words (like prepositions).
	What those \"childish errors\" really show are that children are generating language, not just repeating it.	With due regard to @mollyocr's answer, I shall answer my own question.
1.60	A part of the question thusfar unattended is whether the concept of phoneme has always been contentious.	\"Phoneme\" is a theoretical construct which probably can't go away.
	You should clarify the question a bit to make sure you mean 'writing systems', not languages.	In the Old Ethiopic language Ge'ez a double dot (:) was used to separate words.
1.40	If you arecomming from the non-linguistics environment, the best book is to start with Is Fromkin, Introduction to language.	This is what they recommend at Oxford as introductory textbooks to students starting a Masters' in Linguistics.
	My estimation would be between 1000 and 500 years ago, after population drifts but before the European conquest.	One problem is, as you've identified, how to define \"language\".
1.40	From what I'm seeing it's generally accepted that most English speakers have a vocabulary size of 15000 to 20000 words.	According to a statistical estimation I know roughly 7000 words in English.
	\"Not fast\" is in Arabic  ليست سريعة (pronounced something like \"lessat sahirah\").	In fact, it seems to be the case that you do get /r/ in those contexts and specific words (also, 'squash', etc.).
	A quick search of جید on Google returned two relevant results.	What roots cannot denote is the actual and specific performance of an action.
	-er a derivational suffix because it changes the word class to which the entire expression belongs.	I am not convinced that either one of these answers in correct.
	It seems you don't understand the difference between Morphology and Phonology and therefore, the difference between morphemes and phonemes.	'Orthographically similar' might be another term you can use, meaning 'spelled similarly'.
	This answer does not address the source of the Vietnamese word, just the Vietnamese/Lao connection.	Different languages produce their vowels at different positions in the mouth.
	According to this WALS page \"Passive Constructions\", there are five necessary properties of a passive construction.	You may want to start with an excellent review by Leonid Kulikov.
	What could really be hardly translated into Russian is 'privacy' (although some might disagree stating that it is translated as покой).	The Western Desert Language in Australia does not have a word directly equivalent to English 'love'.
	In traditional Principles and Parameters Framework 1, noun phrases (NP) are considered the topmost lexical head.	These are two different representations that depend on your assumption.
	The Farsi word \"جادو\" /dʒɒ:du:/ is thought to be cognate with Sanskrit \"यातु\" /ja:tu/, with a similar meaning.	Avestan yātu-, Middle Persian jādūg, New Persian jādū all mean “sorcerer”, though the NP word is also used for “sorcery” (MP.
	passenger:  How long will the bus stay at the station?	This kind of phonological ambiguity is frequent enough, also because sound may be distorted.
	Latin semen comes from sero, \"to sow\", which in turn comes from the Proto-Indo-European *sē(i)-, \"to sow\".	Hebrew šɛmɛn שמן “oil, fat” is a Semitic cognate of Arabic samn سمن “fat, butter” (with Semitic s1).
	You are right - it is the vibration of the vocal cord that adds \"voice\".	Normally, English \"k\", \"t\" and \"p\" are always aspirated, so they have a very slight \"h\" sound right after them.
	British popular singers do tend to sound American -- but obviously not the choristers at King's College!	I think the academic phonological analysis is true only to a small extent.
	It was too long for the comment, so had to post it as an answer.	@Alenanno's answer is great, but there is yet another factor: conspiracy.
	Jane, I disagree on two points: Hebrew wasn’t (morphologically) simplified because of European Jews; it was mainly syntactically Europeanised.	Interesting response from Ron Maimon, although I am not sure I understand it fully.
	I can think of two main factors which would motivate such a decision.	This is not a scientific account, it may not be accurate, nor am i an expert on the subject.
	As pointed out by others, \"true synonyms\" do not exist.	I think the word you are looking for is plesionym.
	I'm not aware of any publication which has exact percentages for the origins of Monguor vocabulary.	RE: \"some of Mongour are Taoist and Bonan are Muslim\" The Bao'an/Bonan who are officially classified as such live in Gansu.
	At least, in night the \"t\" came from the original PIE word for night, noqu̯ts.	This kind of phonological ambiguity is frequent enough, also because sound may be distorted.
	Things like the Swadesh List are an attempt at a vocabulary list along the lines you are talking about.	I just read about a study on this which used a fascinating methodology.
	In French, all the words are the same if they refer to the same animal or product.	Here is a funny clip from a dramatization of a Japanese class: Nihonjin no Shiranai Nihongo episode 1 clips.
	let me give you a maths example: pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon，??	The OP seems to be bilingual in English in Chinese.
	To decide if a language is related to another language requires showing that they descend from a common ancestor.	At present, the recent findings of Lusitanian inscriptions confirm the bilingual character (indigenous - Latin) of the so called Lusitanian language.
	There's actually been a lot of work on this kind of issue in morphosyntax.	I don't see why a definite article suffix and \"definiteness\" as a noun property contradict each other.
	In medieval Christian theology, things that were left-handed were things that belonged to Satan (or were corrupted by him).	The English word \"right\" comes from Proto-Indo-European word o̯reĝtos which meant \"correct\" and had cognates o̯reĝr \"directive, order\", o̯reĝs \"king, ruler\", o̯reĝti \"guides, directs\", o̯reĝi̯om \"kingdom\".
	I have a pair with the big-toe strap, and they're very comfortable when I wear them with toe socks.	I have gone through three pairs, two without the toe strap, and one with.
3.00	A tent may give you slightly more protection than sleeping out in the open, but not much.	No, a tent will not give you any protection from bears that want what's inside.
	Although I agree with AM_Hawk as down being both light and compressible, I'd also suggest layering your clothing.	Down is the lightest and most compressible delivering the best warmth.
3.20	A few points to add here: Coyotes are not know to be aggressive towards humans.	In general they are not considered dangerous because they rarely attack humans.
	In case you don't have anything to put on your bites, i found out the following.	I use Solarcaine, which contains a local anesthetic, on both mosquito bites and sunburn.
	In case of ascending on a rockface it does not really matter which way round you use it.	I always ascend the other way around (foot-prusik above the chest prusik).
	As mentioned in other answers, it will depend on the type of your backpack.	I have gone through three pairs, two without the toe strap, and one with.
	Bear spray is a more humane option; however, you do ask about legal repercussions.	You can shoot a human in self defense, so don't worry about shooting a bear if you have to.
	We use a padded bag that goes around the waist like the dreaded fanny pack.	I've been using a LowePro TLZ bag clipped to the front of my pack, just above the sternum straps.
	The outside of a tent is designed to get wet, the key trick is to keep everything else dry.	There are all kinds of people who put up the fly first, then crouch under it putting up the inside.
	I recently hiked in the desert in April and drank 8 oz per half hour, which was a pint an hour.	I carry 6L in the Mojave dunes but find that I only drink 3 to 4L.
	In Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland You can camp almost anywhere in forest and near public waters.	Generally in England and Wales it is illegal to wild camp anywhere without prior permission from the land owner.
	If boiling isn't an option, aqua mira is usually a good choice.	Fecal contamination should not really be an issue unless someone is already sick.
2.80	Nylon dries fast, is resistant to ripping and tearing, and fairly breathable.	Nylon, among other synthetics, is an ideal material for clothing for most outdoor pursuits for several reasons.
	The band actually works like a taut line hitch knot.	The simplest ones are like this, and even the more complex ones are typically broadly similar.
3.40	GPS (wikipedia) is based on orbiting satellites and so is accurate worldwide.	GPS systems can, and do, work everywhere you can get satellites.
	The simple solution is not to rub your arms against your torso.	There is a product called naked surf that you can apply as a liquid rash guard.
	To actually load a person onto a boat, try a parbuckle.	If there is another person person onboard, have them do nothing but watch the person in the water.
	The main reason it's buried is to keep it from washing into water supplies.	Actually it's looking like Bio-charing the waste is going to be the best option.
	Warmth -- This is after all why you are buying the bag.	The key factors are going to vary from person to person.
2.00	Different parts of California have different wildlife, so you should probably narrow the region.	American black bears They are somewhat common in some wilderness areas of California, mostly in the mountains.
2.80	So it's important to have a basic understanding before you even get on skis.	Skiing is a sport where taking lessons pays off very quickly.
	I would consider using OSM as they are available for garmin devices.	I'm going to say that fit is one of the most important elements.
	I follow a paleotic diet (which is gluten-free) for fairly similar reasons.	First, sorry to hear the diagnosis, but you are not alone.
	So there is a known reason for the order not to drink tap water.	If you are being asked to boil water it has a biological contamination.
	As I noted in my answer to that question, plasticene or stress balls work.	Whilst walking about, clench your fist, then stretch your hand open again.
	My favorite fireside activity is my family's version of 20 questions.	I think Kate Gregory's answer has covered the most important issues.
	You may have luck with a thermos flask, or similar insulated flask above a regular water bottle.	I use a \"Camelbak Stoaway\" bladder - it has a bit of insulation and neoprene on the tube.
	What I do is wrap the duct tape around a pencil.	Duct tape wraps around items fairly and can be stored by wrapping on your gear.
	If you drop a belay plate you can use a Munter Hitch to descend down the rope.	One method is to build a brake out of carabiners.
	Icebug specializes in shoes made for running on ice or other very slippery surfaces.	As stated by Graham in his comment, I would recommend using ice traction device like this one or this one.
	You need to have clothes for the coldest part of the trip, at the mountaintop.	When hiking in the cold you need to be able to sweat but not get cold.
0.00	In a gym, the toprope will be wrapped over a cylindrical bar.	Alright, there are several different issues here that we must be sure to address.
	Glucosamine is for cartilage, and finger pain from climbing is probably tendon problems.	I've had a very large number of finger and tendon injuries over 20 years of climbing.
0.20	I visit AZ every summer and include some hikes in the desert when I'm there.	Apart from what has been said, your need of water also depends on what you eat.
	The obvious thing to consider would be how loud the whistle is.	Pea vs. Pealess -- In very cold temperatures, pea whistles don't work Volumn -- Louder is better... to a point.
0.80	A wonderful woman I know has the Habenera bag by REI (link).	If you can settle on purple Nunatak and Feather Friends have good sleeping bags in those colors.
	Cross-loading with certain belay devices - take a look at the Rhino carabiner which is specially constructed to prevent cross loading.	Keeping some outward tension on the belay device really helps.
	A few others I could think of: Foxes Foxes are generally not aggressive are easily scared away by humans.	In the UK we have, comparative to other countries, very few venomous creatures.
	We've camped for a month (4 adults/no kids), no TV, no phone, no radio or power & one water spigot.	Tie the end of the yarn to the bottom-most thread of the warp.
	There are several factors you should considering when judging the severity of a fall.	Perhaps manufacturers advise on how much strain their ropes could take before retirement?
	Close your eyes and stay in a prone position with as few bounces as possible.	I'm a sailboat skipper with 25 years experience, so perhaps my tips could help a bit.
0.00	An embolism in a medical context refers to any large moving mass or defect in the blood stream.	Here is an interesting article on wikipedia to give overview of pressure related injuries.
	If you have space, you can seperate the tent body and the tent poles and pack them on the inside.	As mentioned in other answers, it will depend on the type of your backpack.
	Go to your nearest military surplus store and ask if they have any arctic water bottles.	We've been using flexible Platypus reservoirs and have had no trouble thus far.
	First off, let me admit, I have never made crack-climbing gloves with tape.	To me, hiking is totally different from the rest of the activities on the list.
	I wouldn't say it's necessarily better for the things you outline than the other common options.	I would since a tampon has more than one use example this link shows 10 different ways to use one (http://artofmanliness.com/2012/06/05/survival-tampon/).
	For hard-packed or icy snow, steel runner sleds are quite fast.	We have tested many sleds over the years and this one is as dangerously fast as it is classically beautiful.
	If you haven't climbed in a while I would recommend staying away from doing fingertip pull-ups on hang boards.	Climbing is the best exercise for finger and hand strength improvement, just make sure to warm up and stretch.
	On more than one occasion, having forgotten DEET, we have just rubbed down with raw garlic.	I've heard good things about Badger Balm protecting from biting bugs.
	Although technology has brought us many conveniences most of them require supporting power or other technology.	The first solution that comes to mind is a \"zeer\", or pot-in-pot refrigerator.
	Mosquitoes love me, so I've had opportunity to try many variations of repellent.	DEET can be harmful to the skin if you suffer from any skin disorders such as Eczema (as I do).
	well there are many ways to prevent this, the easyiest way would be to trim the hair between the paws.	Since it has been a year and some of this has not been mentioned I felt compelled to do so.
	If I already had the right to vote I would give a +1 to Patrick Scott's answer.	The most common for rock climbing are with fingerboards or campus boards.
	Many fish will strike at any moving object of roughly the right shape.	You can use any piece of lint, string, or leaves, to make a makeshift lure.
	When talking about fresh, dry clothes then it's not true.	My experience tell me this: sleep naked always if there's no sign of a possible avalanche.
	I think if you're seeing damage your concern is valid.	I lived in Yosemite for over a year and saw TONS of tree belay stations.
	I haven't used this trick for your exact issue but I have used it for similar issues.	By far the simplest and most hygienic solution is to buy two sets.
	There are a few techniques that amount to just this.	This isn't something a real fisherman would do, so if you really want to learn to fish don't do it.
	Children are a relatively high risk on board a small boat.	Infants & Toddlers most of the time will not know about safety.
	Google maps is free as in beer but doesn't usually show hiking trails.	I enjoy being alone, but I'll bring a book and some music for when I'm in my tent.
	You need to distill it - I'm assuming that freezing is not an option (unless you're camping in the extreme latitudes).	Outdoors you can dig a hole and build SOLAR STILL.
4.20	It would be unusual for a snake to attack a stationary person.	I'm no herpetologist, but in my experience, snakes are in the \"you don't bug me, I won't bug you\" category.
	I am near Seattle and I am getting some miles in around Snoqualmie and Middle Fork Wilderness areas.	I realize you already made your trip, but I will answer your question anyhow.
0.20	As I wrote above, it's hard to rate this wall.	Unlike others, I think the route is pretty well described.
	You are right, if you gain 3000+ meters within 6 hours, you are susceptible to AMS.	As your body gets used to the altitude, the symptoms go away.
	I picked up a memory foam travel pillow for around $5 at Canadian Tire a few years back.	Have you tried fitting them both into a single pillowcase?
	What was already said: pee and don't drink before sleeping.	From my comment - Some people keep a jar in the tent to pee in.
	This doesn't directly answer your question and might not be to your liking, but it's what I do.	In dry climates you can take advantage of evaporative cooling - especially on a bike.
	Probably the best thing you can do to acclimate to the cold is to live in it.	Acclimatization isn't purely psychological; it is actually a physiologically different response based upon recent exposure and experience.
	In average to less than average physical shape, I'd say that is pushing it a bit.	Can you do some local training hikes on similar terrain before heading out there?
	There are a few differences between the SOT kayaks and a touring kayak that you'll want to consider.	I would recommend checking out something like Hobie's Mirage pedal driven kayaks.
	Imsodin's answer is good and covers a lot of good points.	I am not entirely sure, but I think you are referring to boots like the La Sportiva Nepal.
3.20	Once you open it up to toxins, the answer is clearly no, boiling is not enough.	Boiling eliminates only a certain class of contaminants that can make you ill.
	I use Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus(OLE) and it works great.	DEET is really evil, it is a dissolvent that is able to etch the plastic cap!
	If you are being asked to boil water it has a biological contamination.	I have several gluten-intolerant people in my life, and though I haven't taken them camping, here's how I would feed them.
	Couscous is one of the best sources of carbohydrate I've found.	For pure calorific content, you cant beat Kendall Mint Cake.
	Oh friend, I have been down this miserable road just like you.	Holding on to crimpers is what causes pain in my finger-joints.
	The most common for rock climbing are with fingerboards or campus boards.	Hartley (and Phil) pretty much have it covered, but I'd add a couple of things.
0.00	Different parts of California have different wildlife, so you should probably narrow the region.	You can get a rough estimate from using an online calorie estimation website.
	The rucksacks that I own, have extra long straps as well.	Clip together any unclipped compression straps even if you aren't tightening them, just to reduce the length that flaps around.
	I like the question although I am not a geocacher at all.	I don't want, however, to inform anyone around about that cache - I want to keep it secret only for 'chosen'.
	You can sit on your hands or cross your arms over your chest, clench a fist, and pump your muscles.	If your fingers are to the cold point where you cant feel them, then not much is going to help.
	If you have children with you, you will have no worries about keeping yourself busy, you'll be plenty busy.	My favorite fireside activity is my family's version of 20 questions.
	The British Mountaineering Council (BMC) has a downloadable helmet guidebook which addresses this question pretty well.	In my opinion you should also take the hybrid helmets into account.
	If you're staying out overnight, consider digging a snowhole instead of using a tent.	I've not camped in subzero weather before but I have spent several hours working on glaciers.
	If you wear a bear bell on your backpack, your fellow hikers will kill you for being annoying.	Again, tie a secure loop in the rope near the second sack.
	To deal with low oxygen environments you need more red blood cells.	General fitness is the only technique you can employ without going to higher altitudes.
0.60	If you wear a bear bell on your backpack, your fellow hikers will kill you for being annoying.	The above advice is quite good, just wanted to add on thing to consider regarding food in bear country.
	I clean my drinking system with lots of hot water then sterilise it using baby bottle sterilising tablets.	Here is a few videos on how you can clean your hydration pack.
	Figure 8 pattern is good but there is also another pattern which can be useful.	The first two images on this site (pictured below) show how you can pack your rope without producing tangles.
0.00	Oh friend, I have been down this miserable road just like you.	Yes, it is accepted practice to wash new Semi-Static rope (or Single Rope Technique/SRT Rope as it is known by cavers).
	For every item, I weigh up the regularity of use, vs the urgency of use.	Stuff is first put into plastic bags according to type.
	Sleeping pads: I was on a motorcycle trip with very little storage space.	Tent: A 2 person tent divides up really well between Tent/rainfly, and poles/groundcloth, a 4 person tent breaks down each component even more.
	If it's honeydew, then soap & water should do the trick.	From experience with small sections I have used hand sanitizer and it works.
	I wouldn't buy an ultralight tent if you're going to put the tent through severe trauma or require significant space (e.g.	I have bought the Copper Spur 3 and slept in it now on a cottage lawn and on a backcountry campsite.
	I believe the threads are generally compatible, BUT that's not the issue.	I first bought a MSR Fuel Bottle (325 ml, aluminum) for packing denatured alcohol for my Trangia stove.
	I would consider \"Rock Climbing\" as something in the Class 5 definition of the YDS grading system.	According to my father (a self-identified mountaineer), the difference is as follows: A rock climber encounters a cliff on a mountainside.
	There are 2 things that you need to watch out for: Wind chill and getting wet due to sweating.	Here's my attempt to make a truly thorough answer to the question of cold-weather clothing.
	Actually, electric fences with an attached alarm are pretty common when camping in Svalbard (lots and lots of polar bears).	Are you sure this is a good idea at all?
4.80	My opinion is to wait for the child to ask for it.	My opinion is to wait until the child itself expresses a desire for this.
3.80	You are safe to use the bottles as long as they have been properly sterilised.	I would say it's completely safe so long as the bottles have been adequately rinsed to remove any detergent residue.
1.80	He is taking the diaper off because he is uncomfortable.	You can try putting the diaper on backwards which may only work for a little while.
	I recommend fewer, longer stops instead of short, frequent stops.	I DO NOT recommend night driving--especially if your drive is in excess of ten hours.
	First of all, you should get past the idea that you are going to get her to change.	I agree that you need to take care of this prior to your child being born.
	There is something that a teacher told us regarding the bullying between our toddler (3) and our infant (1 year).	When you are talking about babies and toddlers, bullying is a lot simpler than it can be with older children.
	I'd ensure you got professional advice before committing your children to a vegan diet.	If you omit eggs and dairy, it becomes very difficult to get adequate nutrients.
0.40	I would recommend asking questions in a way that doesn't require a yes or no answer.	Would you be concerned with the mind changing if he wasn't shouting and/or misbehaving?
	I'm multilingual too, able to turn the language switch in the brain without effort.	I would simply like to recommend a book that is fabulous for your situation.
2.60	Yes, twins can develop their own language, but it's not a given.	Here's what I saw with my fraternal twins: While learning to speak, all children develop some of their own dialect.
1.60	Whatever you do, don't bite him back to show him that it hurts.	We always lightly bopped our kids on the mouth, therefore showing him that his mouth is what hurt you.
1.40	A rule of thumb that I've heard is \"for small children, big dogs\".	Any breed of dog can be perfectly safe or extremely dangerous.
	You can try cutting the nails when they are asleep.	The longer it has been since the last feeding, the easier it should be to pump.
	My opinion is to wait for the child to ask for it.	I really wanted my ears pierced, but my parents said I had to wait until I was 10 years old.
	They should be rewarded for good behavior in the process of learning the good behavior.	There are those who feel that rewards are just as counter-productive as punishments.
2.00	I know of no firm evidence indicating that baby talk is either helpful or detrimental in language development.	Baby talk, when used correctly is beneficial to speech development.
	I've always used the 1-2-3 countdown method, but as stated in the chosen post, this requires training.	I have never worked out how to get a child to listen first time.
1.80	A possibility is to have a family meeting with the stated goal of working out the reward(s) for chores.	Many children, instead of being motivated by reward are motivated by being in control.
	At a certain time, the answer would have been a quick spanking or at least a swat on the behind.	As @tomjedrz said, they do go from being baby carriers to stuff carriers and are always useful in that regard.
	There are actually more than 2 methods of teaching a child to sleep through the night.	I think there's too many factors at play to determine the proper age to use cry it out.
	Pacifier use too early, or, indeed, any artificial nipple use too early can definitely lead to nipple confusion.	Here are two sites with the results of research on nipple confusion.
1.20	The point is to get the air out that the infant sucks into the stomach while feeding.	I've found with my baby that it's more accurate to go by his behavior than by \"rules\".
	You make sure to praise hard work rather than natural gifts.	I suggest looking to offer up as many resources regarding his interests as you can.
	Most martial arts schools don't take kids until they are 4 or 5, depending on the class and the school.	My sister put her son in a martial arts class and was nervous because he is really shy.
	I wouldn't say this was an absolute necessity, but I absolutely love having a video baby monitor.	Another strange thing that I wish I had the foresight to buy earlier are \"Pool noodles\".
	Nicknames - people (especially in Australia) will always have their names reduced to the minimum number of syllables.	Being from India, our criteria was: How will it sound to international English speakers?
	Remember also that there are no foods that cannot be eaten at breakfast.	Instead of the bacon we use slices of ham or turkey depending on which brand has less sodium in it.
	Would you be concerned with the mind changing if he wasn't shouting and/or misbehaving?	Young children often are overwhelmed with options, especially when tired.
	Yeah, that schedule is an excellent way of making sure you get enough sleep.	In general, I would do the same thing to an 18 year old as any of my kids.
0.80	You should have a consultation route with the school head which can lead to direct consultation with a health professional.	It is always difficult when parents refuse to see what seems obvious to a teacher.
	A very good friend of mine helped my wife and I cope when the strain of a strong-willed toddler.	She's probably into the first growth spurt already and as such is hungry all the time.
2.20	You will be hard pressed to find scientific studies that answer these questions with any certainty.	The topics you mention are very broad and not closely related in the scientific world.
3.20	Although cheese is very healthy and also good during pregnancy, some types might contain Listeria, which can cause serious problems.	As was mentioned, the problem with cheese is the potential for Listeria.
	I actually involved my Daughter in with helping me and my son when he was born.	I think it's important that you make time for the older child so they don't feel neglected.
	I would suggest you to look into baby sleeping bags.	We have allowed our boys to use afghans at night since about 9 months old.
	Since you're allergic, what sort of detergent do you use personally to prevent negative reactions?	My daughter used to have a reaction when we used normal detergents.
	Praise is a wonderful motivator as long as the praise is for the \"right\" things.	I've actually heard the opposite, at least for younger kids.
	The fact that she played with her toys for 3 hours indicates that there is NOT anything physically wrong.	Pick her up if she doesn't relax after a few calm \"sleep now, dear\".
	My sister is a dentist, so she gave a cute toothbrush with lights on it.	There are two most likely scenarios here: Your child may have oral-sensory issues.
	The Met Opera has showings of operas in local movie theaters.	My 8yo is a budding opera geek... has been for at least a year and a half.
	You only need to bath your baby 2-3 times a week.	Baby pimples actually have little to nothing to do with cleanliness.
	If the child falls and cries unusually then make sure to check.	A friend told me it's when they are silent that there is a problem.
	As a teacher and a recently back to work mom, I think there are more cons than pros.	The fact that she played with her toys for 3 hours indicates that there is NOT anything physically wrong.
	Both of my kids have some form of lactose intolerance.	Same here, except we are dealing with milk protein which means not even lactose free milk.
	Another strategy is to survey the nursing staff at the hospital asking who they use for their children.	Aside from asking people with children for recommendations, try asking an OB/GYN.
	With our twins (13 months old) we have a bedtime routine starting around 7 (earlier if they are cranky).	As HedgeMage said, a routine is very very important, especially the story telling part.
	It sounds as though you're going through something I went through a little while ago.	According to my personal experience there's no better way to be the best exapmle to your kids.
	Peer pressure is empowered by the drive to belong and be accepted.	I was not allowed to watch Soap Operas while I was growing up.
1.40	Both of our children slept in a portable pen for at least their first year, and there were no problems.	Yours looks like the one we used for my kids (same brand and everything).
	In addition to reading, flash cards are also  a great way to increase vocabulary.	Nouns are great, but it's also important to include other parts of speech (adverbs, adjectives, etc.).
	First, constantly reassure her that she has nothing to fear.	a) As soon as he can count, add and subtract; b) When he spends significant time outside home without parents.
1.40	I have never read anything that said teethers were bad--where did you read that?	We used a clean cloth or baby sock wrapped around an ice cube with our kids and grandkids.
	First and foremost you and your partner need to identify what styles of learning work best for you.	A rather standard answer is \"What to expect when you're expecting\" book.
	Alternative hubby perspective: Nothing went wrong, and I still don't think it was a waste of time.	The potential that you will learn something makes it absolutely worth it.
	As a speech language pathologist, I've been trained in treating stuttering.	I was at the University of Alberta while they were doing a 2-week clinic for people (adults) who stutter.
	Interesting that she was happy with it for about 2 weeks.	Actually, it looks like there are multiple options for organic formula.
	I struggled at bath time with my children (now 2, 3, and 4) when they were very little.	Our daughter has always loved her bath, but coming out... not so much.
	We have a routine called 'going to the window'-- the preschool/day care has a window overlooking the parking lot.	Similar to those mentioned earlier, we too have a routine to leave.
	I had a problem with grinding my teeth when I was young.	Relaxation exercises before bed can help as well as holding a cork in the front teeth for 1 minute before bed.
0.00	I'm facing a similar situation; being Danish and living in (German-speaking) Austria.	An alternative would be to expose her solely or additionally to Hindi in daycare.
	I've done a lot of road trips and a few airplane trips with my now 6-year-old and often alone.	Though I always start with non-electronic activities, I make sure to keep a few tucked into my bag as a backup.
1.60	My son didn't become potty trained until about his 4th birthday.	Here are some things that worked with my son who started toilet training around 2.5 years.
	We use the 1.2.3 rule, and I'm a computer programmer, and my oldest son (6 years old) loves math.	We really tried avoiding 1,2,3 with our son, preferring time outs, but time outs just weren't that effective.
	According to Web MD a seven-year-old should get about 10 to 11 hours of sleep per day.	I have the same problem with my 7 year old son.
	As other people have said, it sounds like your parents did you a disservice by not preparing you correctly.	I don't think you should be afraid of this conversation at all.
	My daughter, also 10, tends to have great plans but no follow through.	I don't think there a games the specifically do this, however most games will lend themselves to this skill.
	I would think of this as a gift that your son has.	Quite simply: stop doing it, stop letting the siblings and grandparents do it.
	Be honest about how everyone has flaws and makes mistakes.	A good question might be some things not to buy.
	I know for a fact that sucking the lower lip does cause a bulging misshaped blob on the lower lip.	I can't scientifically debunk the myth you mention, but I've never heard of it and I don't think it's true.
	I evaluate based on what my parents did or didn't do.	If you are asking the question, then that's all that matters.
	This is anecdotal, but: One of my cousins had a similar problem when he was a child.	As the comments have said, don't be afraid to ask your pediatrician about it, since it worries you.
	Is it possible that you gave up swaddling too early?	I had a bedtime routine and followed a 3 hour cycle for my infant (at the time newborn).
	When a baby cries, it gets more and more worked up.	The fact that she played with her toys for 3 hours indicates that there is NOT anything physically wrong.
	You didn't specify how you put him to bed, so here are a few suggestions.	After visiting 2 urgent cares and our pediatrician the recommendation is unanimous.
	I had a bedtime routine and followed a 3 hour cycle for my infant (at the time newborn).	We abandoned swaddling at 4 weeks because our son would scream and thrash when being swaddled.
	I assume your child is also being addressed by someone else in English?	Personally, I feel the volume of words is more important, than the diversity, at least early on.
0.80	Show her how much fun splashing is - that's what we did, and made a game of it.	You can put her toys near her or give he toys to her.
	Let him know that you love him very much and that you have rules for his betterment.	Tell him: Father is not only a title, its a job.
	It's difficult for everyone when a child is fighting sleep.	We're soon to be moving our son from his toddler bed to a full sized bed.
	From my own and others' experience, I'd say around 6-9 years of age is the time when they figure it out.	Some things to try: Remove all chocolate and mint from her diet.
	My 13 month old son has been transfixed by the TV since day 1.	Some of the other answers seem to address older children.
2.80	Our daughter has always loved her bath, but coming out... not so much.	My wife and I originally had the same problem with our newborn twins fussing when bath time was over.
	As a programmer i would propose to you the following: Abstract thinking, Pragmatic Thinking, Higher problem solving.	In addition to the other suggestions, I'd say make sure he can type relatively accurately.
	Bring lots of toys for your child to play with, books, activities.	I have always heard its a bad idea until they're two.
	I think a daily family supper is a good idea.	I've tried to work on this with emotional intelligence: helping my kids understand what they and other people are feeling.
1.80	Playing doctor is something all kids want to try at some point.	I have been in a simular situation with my daughter and a female friend when they were 5 and 4.
	Coincidentally, we watched tv with our 6 week old twins last night for about 3 hours.	There's probably a study to support whatever theory there is you want to believe in.
	One concern I have about bring my baby in wooded areas is ticks.	Nothing really special for camping that you don't already do when you go out.
	20 years ago my wife and I took Lamaze classes during the pregnancy.	The usual guidance given sounds odd: in early years leadership is learned by example.
	We had a problem with an older one (partially related to a younger child's birth) as far as #2.	A newborn will start issues (as we've had) with jealousy, and a whole new set of attention seeking behaviour.
0.67	Most doctors do recommend rice cereal as the first food, as there is almost no worry of allergic reaction.	Eating off a spoon has to be an unusual experience for them.
	This question is rhetorical because it answered itself by using the word \"profanity\".	Its not just profanity but other words that are derisive of other people etc.
	After doing some research on this, it seems that some tantrum behaviors might be warning signs of problems.	I have 5 kids (20, 18, 10, 8, 6) and none of them ever threw a tantrum.
2.60	Most of the literature I can find about infant sleeping has to do primarily with waking habits, not eating habits.	In my experience, babies tend to wake up by themselves when they get hungry.
	Being excluded from normal classes to get remedial work is definitely not good for your self-esteem.	I think that it is greatly dependent on the culture of the school and they way it is done.
	our daughter had, what we were told were, night terrors.	Our son started doing something similar but not quite as bad.
	Given the opportunity, children will play computer games all day, and ignore everything else going on around them.	The main feedback I can provide here is to model the behavior you want to see in your child.
0.40	Here is my advice based on my personal experience pumping breastmilk for twin boys for a full year.	I understand that the first 3 days are the most important, so much so it is vital you do it then.
	Perhaps the easiest thing to do would be to keep more balanced snacks readily available.	I had a similar problem with my daughter (I called her the carb junkie).
	Most modern baby monitors use digital transmission (most often the DECT standard).	The simplistic answer is to buy two from different manufacturers.
2.40	It is possible, but it will have to be a docile female betta and a bigish tank.	We tried putting a male betta in a community tank once.
	You indicate in your comments that your hamster does not have hay.	You can't expect your pet to keep mum if you are not with him.
2.80	Turtles love eating goldfish and lots of things that fit into their mouths.	First, the turtles are eating the fish because fish are food, not friends.
2.00	Given that the amount of shedding is normal, I don't think there's anything you can do to lessen it.	To reduce the amount of fur a cat malts over your furniture and clothes you could try a deshedder brush.
	You're looking at roughly 3-4 cups of food twice a day.	It really all depends on what you feed the dog.
3.00	My experience with Danios has that they always have been \"bossy\" fish.	Breed Zebra Danios are extremely hardy fish, they are almost difficult to kill.
	My answer's going to be the same as one I've previously given.	If you're looking for a pet, I would probably suggest guinea fowl.
	Okay, so you've got a dog running around without a leash and one that won't let you catch him?	I had a dog with Cushing's Disease, and he gobbled food.
	To be honest, this just sounds like normal puppy behavior.	I am not an expert, just happen to have lived the same thing a couple of months ago.
	Another issue you might want to consider is that as cats get older their colon response gets weaker.	In general I'd say one should feed cats wet food instead of dry.
2.60	I have seen cats not like using the litterbox for a variety of reasons.	I think Keltari has some good ideas.... A cat can change its \"taste\" in litter material.
	So, in general I would avoid bathing a cat unless there's a real strong need to do so.	Don't use regular shampoo -- cats have very sensitive skin and regular shampoo will dry it out and irritate it.
	I have had really good results using carPET Scratch Stoppers in doorways and under doors.	Cover the entrance to the doorway with a old carpet and use a staple guns to secure it.
	I always leave Bear (7 months old, now)  with a Kong when I leave for the day.	I had a dog with Cushing's Disease, and he gobbled food.
1.80	Cats (and all animals in general) do not understand the concepts of order or tidiness.	They don't intend to leave those items around the house or untidy the house.
3.80	It does sound like your cat is upset about something, and trying to communicate it to you.	Something is bothering your cat and he does not like it.
3.00	I have noticed most cats don't lick people a great deal.	Cats may or may not lick a person based on all kinds of things.
1.40	How could be you so sure that the fish died a natural death.	In my 200 L fresh water tank, which is an aggressive tank, fish occasionally get harassed to death.
	I have a Siberian Husky that is not much older than your dog.	I would definitely ask his vet how much he thinks is too much for the dog's age and physical state.
	For performance dogs we like to wait until 18 months on average.	There's an answer to this on Cesar Millan's website from a vet.
	You could increase the fiber in the diet just like a human would with this issue.	I do not believe there is a specific diet which will ensure that no feces remains on a dog's backside.
	I actually like Nature's Miracle as far as pet stain and smell removers go.	Home Depot has a great product called \"Odoban\" which is an all natural enzymatic cleanser that eliminates urine stains/odors.
	Cats nails keep growing and they have the need to scratch to shorten them and keep them dulled down.	I have had really good results using carPET Scratch Stoppers in doorways and under doors.
	My cat has lost a number of teeth - but refuses to go on a solely wet food diet.	Unfortunately, have no external sources, but my father is a veterinarian and my mother is a pet dietary consultant.
	Ah yes, I had that problem with some of my cats, years ago.	I've made sure to have more cardboard boxes around for my youngest cat to shred and bite.
	My cat has lost a number of teeth - but refuses to go on a solely wet food diet.	I feed my cats a roughly 50/50 diet of wet and dry.
1.60	First, double-check the dog's body language to make sure that it is truly aggressive.	First, you should realize that this is not you or your dog's problem.
	The answer on backward chaining was very good and I would like to suggest an augmentation to that approach.	Although I'm 100% in favour of clicker training, in this case it might not be the best approach to start with.
0.00	The appropriate pH level of the water does vary a bit by fish, but too acidic can definitely kill them.	The info you've been given in the previous answers is good.
0.60	My guess is that means your cat only marginally likes the food you're feeding him.	Some researchers believe domestic cats never really mentally grow up completely and they always look at you like their mom.
	I would look into how much water the dog is drinking in a day.	Try to wash the food bowl and the water bowl.
	Nearly any cover you buy or build will allow enough air to circulate.	Covers are also there to prevent things from getting in.
	You say that you have scratching posts around your house, but they may not be the right type.	From my experience, attempts to stop cats from scratching things generally fail.
	We never gave our foster pup (who LOVES to chew) rawhides because we've heard that they're dangerous if they splinter.	In my experience the benefits of chewing raw or smoked bones far outweigh the draw backs.
0.00	Cover the entrance to the doorway with a old carpet and use a staple guns to secure it.	I started to dig into this because you caught my curiosity itch with the question...
	As long as it's not completely sealed air will get in.	Covers are also there to prevent things from getting in.
	Teaching a retrieve is a great example of when you can use backchaining to get your desired effect.	The answer on backward chaining was very good and I would like to suggest an augmentation to that approach.
	You should feed your cat twice a day but in summer they won´t eat as much as they do normally.	Since cats in nature hunt at dawn and dusk, a two meals a day strategy fits best with their nature.
	I have had very good luck with two different obese cats using a Tiger Diner cat bowl.	Most \"diet\" cat foods load up on carbs, which cats don't need (they're carnivores!).
	I wouldn't recommend keeping the giant gourami with any of the fish you have in Tank 2.	Going by your pictures, no, you can't combine these fish.
	As a reminder: There are many cats who have lived long and happy lives on dry food.	I have used human tuna fish cans when I have forgotten cat food for a day or so.
	With descending paralysis the strong rear leg muscles will have lots of strength.	I've seen on the \"Dog Whisperer\" that dogs can sense the anxiety that an owner has.
	It is normal for a cat to get upset if an unfamiliar creature passes 'their' lawn/street/window.	You could try installing a privacy film on your windows.
	It is major surgery and there's always a chance that the cat won't wake up from anesthesia.	They don't intend to leave those items around the house or untidy the house.
	One piece of advice I've seen is to use bait to lure the snails out, and then physically remove them.	You might consider adding a few Assassin Snails to the tank.
3.40	Try switching to rats; weanling rats if you need something smaller.	As mentioned in previous answers, rats and gerbils can be offered instead of mice or in a rotation with mice.
3.60	You should take this animal to a vet right away.	As covered in the other answers, your only option is to see a vet in order to have surgery done.
2.20	The main cause of the allergies is proteins in the saliva.	Allergies to animals, particularly furry ones, can be across the board rather than species specific.
	Ammonia is present in urine as a by-product of meat consumption, so its presence is entirely natural.	Drinking more water, urine smelling strongly, defecating outside the litter box - all of those signs sound like she's sick.
	The ASPCA website has an exhaustive list of toxic and non-toxic plants for dogs, cats, and horses.	I would say, unless you know it is safe for cats assume it to be poisonous.
	I have had great luck with Thundershirts in calming my pets, both cats and dogs.	One thing to keep in mind is to not try to comfort your pet.
	I would say start by familiarizing the dog with the baby's scent.	The Humane Society of the United States has a few suggestions to prepare your pet.
	For most of mine I do what Kyle does: stand the carrier on end and put the cat in rump-first.	All but one current answers talk about \"forcefully\" putting the animal into the carrier.
	The behavior in wolves is known as \"scrape behavior\"; it is also present in their domesticated relatives.	From what i know, It's an extra way of being territorial.
3.00	There are a few things to help your bun gain a bit of weight.	John Cavan has some reasonable and appropriate methods for increasing a rabbits weight in his answer.
1.80	Stocking is very subjective to the specific inhabitants as well as the setup and your aquarium experience.	You'll always want to add fish into a tank slowly.
	I've found that having existing tartar on the teeth is the worst culprit for stinky breath.	Try to wash the food bowl and the water bowl.
	Sadly, you can't communicate to the female \"hey its only play... he actually likes you\".	To be honest, I think you're asking the wrong question.
	It may be worth trying one of the artificial pheromone sprays.	You could always close or add curtains to the windows.
	As he goes to get the food, you'll want to say your command.	Cats are hard to train, but not impossible, and a lot of is really tied to their natural interests.
	Zaralynda has a fantastic answer, that runs counter to my in belief the \"badness\" of iceberg lettuce for bunnies.	In short, iceberg lettuce is mostly water with little to no nutrient value.
	The antibiotics should hopefully help keep the itching down, so that he won't scratch at it.	So the vet assumed it was some kind of infection, though she seemed a bit clueless.
	Another alternative for feeding pills is to just put the pill in the rabbits mouth.	I would suggest finding a compounding pharmacy and talking to someone there.
	Odds are, the cat's as wary of you as you are of her.	Another option: If this cat tends to be rather vocal, she may just want to have a \"conversation\" with you.
	Neutered cats may, or may not, consider it less important to go outside and examine/defend their territory.	He is probably doing this to show his disapproval of you leaving for work everyday.
	I agree with Beo and Zaralynda... both are good advice.	We have a Norwegian Forest Cat who often gets mats and into plenty of messes.
	Is there anything that you would want to do at 3am when you've just been woken up by your cat?	I had similar problems with Pounce de Leon when she was young.
	I adopted a dog who ate fast (the way he was raised and Cushing's Disease).	Other than avoidance, there may be a few things you can do.
	Your cats are still closer to kitten than to true adult and they want to hunt and pounce for practice.	I believe that there isn't an association between strings on toys and shoelaces.
	Pipolino Kong for cats Catit feeding maze SmartCat Tiger Diner Portion Control Cat Bowl, cf.	I believe the current worlds record is something like 36-37 years old.
	Pet stores do sell \"Pet Grass\" which gives them something to chew on (or grow your own).	I have lots of plants and keep them all behind closed doors so none of my cats can eat them.
	This is a good example of overstocking a fish tank.	The first, and possibly most important, thing to look at is your tank size.
	Going by your pictures, no, you can't combine these fish.	You can have Giant Gowra with any fish like Oscar, Koi carp, Angel, Giant Gowra, etc.
	Diet management of iodine intake for your cat is going to be very difficult with food intended for human consumption.	Science Hills now do a dry and wet food diet that is iodine-free, it's called y/d.
2.40	The best approach is play with your cat each night in the evening before bedtime.	A trick I did was to grab and hold my cats close if they disturbed me during the night.
	Perhaps she will respond to the sound (or smell, if applicable) of treats.	Okay, so you've got a dog running around without a leash and one that won't let you catch him?
2.60	I don't have direct experience with bettas, but I've never heard that pairs will work long-term in any male/female combination.	Bettas are highly territorial and no matter what sexes you keep together they will fight.
	Cats are sensitive and highly strung, and can sometimes have odd reactions to being over-stimulated.	I think what you're encountering is called Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome but the common name is rolling skin disease.
	Since the risks and pitfalls of wire floors are largely mentioned, I'll mention pros...	Regardless of floor choice, remember that they need a burrow-like \"safe\" area to cope with stress.
1.40	We always put it crushed up in a bit of butter or on a sardine.	We had a cat that required daily medication, and it was a struggle to give the cat a pill.
	An experiment with chicken: Two cages of chickens had a similar food automatic device.	I think Esa answered the question well and thus have awarded him the answer.
	Odds are, the cat's as wary of you as you are of her.	Some cats (actually many, in my experience) find it difficult to sit or stand still when they are being petted.
	I ended up using a combination of the three answers provided with a slight twist.	As a reminder: There are many cats who have lived long and happy lives on dry food.
1.60	The biggest reason I can think of is that you're taking away a defence mechanism for the cat.	Cats don't usually like to have their paws held, touched, or anything like that.
	People here has answered very well but if nothing helps then barking control collars can help as a last resort.	You can't expect your pet to keep mum if you are not with him.
	Depending on where you live, burying your pet in your yard may be illegal.	At only a few inches deep, it's still easily detected by coyotes and foxes.
	The two primary consideration here are the dogs safety and the ease (or budget) of improvement.	Personally, I'd be wary of leaving a dog outside alone without a physical fenced boundary.
1.60	Breed Zebra Danios are extremely hardy fish, they are almost difficult to kill.	Supposedly Danios need to school which mean you need at least 5-8 Danios in your tank.
	Diatomaceous Earth claims say that it works on fleas/mites by microscopically abrading (cutting) their exoskeleton, essentially drying them out.	So called \"natural\" remedies are not necessarily: more effective; or with less side effects.
	Cats are descended from desert dwelling animals and have their kidneys concentrate the urine very strongly to recover water.	This table from Cornell University lists the specific gravity of urine for dogs, cats, and large animals.
	It's just her style.... My cats all have different eating styles.	I have a cat who does this, and have heard about the behavior in other cats.
	At this stage, I would look to add fish and stop artificially adding ammonia to the system.	Unfortunately I'd say no, not if you still have that much ammonia showing up.
	How could be you so sure that the fish died a natural death.	Diet management of iodine intake for your cat is going to be very difficult with food intended for human consumption.
	Gastric dilation, also know as bloat, is a veterinary emergency.	It is often said that \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\".
	It's possible that your cat, like some people, has simply gotten more finicky with age.	As far as I'm aware of, it's instinctual, to avoid contamination.
	No, goldfish do not \"pair up\" — not socially, and not even in breeding.	Concern about lung development If you are concerned about your cat's health, you should take your cat to the veternarian.
	When a carrier is not a thing to be afraid of, things get a lot easier.	All but one current answers talk about \"forcefully\" putting the animal into the carrier.
	The thing they hate in citrus is the oil (which has the smell).	I found that \"acts of God\" can discourage and even teach cats from doing certain things (e.g.
1.40	Clean the urinated zone with vinegar (I used to do that when my feline daughter was a baby kitten).	Others have made some good suggestions about how to neutralize the odors in the area.
	I have one Maine Coon but she does not do this behavior.	Since we can't know what moves inside a cat's head, it will all be a theory only.
2.80	Aristotle didn't put the world at the center of the universe per se.	Why did Aristotle place the earth at the centre of an infinite universe?
3.80	I don't think that positivism is a position of mostly leftist philosophers.	I am not convinced that positivism is routinely asociated to a leftist ideology.
	It's a non-sequitur, which means that the conclusion \"doesn't follow\" from the premise.	It's fairly clear in this case that the problem is simply a false premise.
	If everything has a cause, then God must have a cause.	There is something rather than nothing because the state of \"nothing\" is UNSTABLE.
	I do not think the possibility of holding contradictory beliefs is controversial.	I'm not certain the preface paradox, as stated, holds water.
	Strictly speaking I believe definitive knowledge is never obtainable, as Karl Popper has convincingly argued.	Broadly speaking, knowledge is objective truth while belief is subjective truth.
	You don't write a dictionary first and then tell people to learn it.	No given dictionary for a language completely describes that language.
	\"To cause\" means that there is an unbroken chain, ordered in time, that links from cause to effect.	The meaning of \"cause\" is very vague, it is a human term, not a scientific term.
	In structural terms, the second sentence isn't incorrect, you just read it incorrectly.	As the t isn't mentioned in the part of Fever(x), we can push it inside.
3.40	Well for one a being could have a non-physical existance and yet not even be in your mind.	The difference is huge, as not all non-physical things exist in minds.
	As a thoroughgoing occasionalist, Malebranche held that all causal activity is divine.	Occasionalism is the position that God is the true and \"efficient\" cause of all that occurs.
	Dr Julin Jaynes speculates in his book; The origin of consciousness in the break down of the bicameral mind.	This is a great question which calls into discussion the nature of groups at all.
	In modern evolutionary biology, teleology is considered to be an irrelevant explanation for what caused things to be.	This is a huge question actually and one of considerable current research.
0.00	People who are good at the philosophy of mathematics are mathematicians and not philosophers.	My motivation is that I like to look at things from their roots and go up.
	I'm afraid I don't have an answer for you, but perhaps I can offer you a somewhat useful non-answer?	Thanks for your help after much searching I could not find anything.
	Rational explanations follow from a specific set of axioms plus rules to go from step to step.	To evaluate a rational explanation, I think it's important to distinguish correct from rational.
	I too am interested in this Budhist topic and offer a humble answer.	First of all: this is an excellent question, and deserves a better response than I can give it.
2.00	The difference between \"necessary\" and \"sufficient\" is the direction of the logical arrow.	sufficient is an upper bound, necessary is a lower bound.
	This is much more a biology/evolution question than a philosophy question.	If limited life span was the result of generational evolution, unlimited lifespan would have been tried and rejected.
0.00	I have no idea why it is voted up, but Rex Kerr's answer begs the question.	It's a tautology, but the mapping between logic and the English-language description is wrong.
	In the case that B, assume A and derive B to yield A implies B.	You can prove it indirectly as follows (if steps (5) and (8) are acceptable to you, of course).
	Yes, if \"natural numbers\" is the commonly agreed on term from arithmetic.	This is more on the lines of commentary on your question, rather than an answer.
	In the above process, nowhere the eyes are actually reading Chinese, but converting it to signals.	The Turing test enables the examiners to see if the judges are unable to distinguish the people from the robots.
3.80	It's true that, under one understanding of \"accessibility\" and \"determining\", your accessibility relation is determined by your axioms.	Accessibility is determined by the axioms of the modal logic you're working within.
	I think this would be an example of a fallacy known as a Red Herring.	I don't think it's either an appeal to logos or pathos, but rather an appeal to ethos.
	I think that the only difference between the two is the semantic objective of the definition.	(philosophy)The system of thought holding that all phenomena can be explained in terms of natural causes and laws.
	Answering my own question, I've found MIT's OpenCourseware to be a good starting point.	Let me question your question briefly, then reassure you, then try to answer it.
	Though I mostly agree with Cody's answer, I wish to answer from different perspectives.	Interesting theoretical answers aside, there is no such thing as \"rights\" or \"entitlements\" -- not really.
	3 is in the set of integers but not in the set of even numbers.	This is not a mathematical argument, so no mathematical response is necessary.
	You say this thing is older than the other, when both has measurable and finite age.	The proof is not valid and it isn't even true.
0.20	I once met a physicists who held the strong AI position.	Although I believe Searle is mistaken, I don't think you have found the problem.
	The list is long, and will depend a lot upon your eventual area of specialization.	I minored in philosophy in college and trying to get back into it after 8 years.
	Consequentialism not only admits but advocates cruel treatment in exactly those cases where there is an overall benefit.	The experiments done by those other than Mengele on prisoners by the Germans saved more lives than they cost.
	I can not refute the argument as it is perfectly sound.	Yes, appeal to lack of evidence to the contrary has a name -> proof of burden.
	I don't think you can find a consistent distiction across philosophers.	I have long pondered this question specifically in reference to mathematics.
	Well, you can always limit the number of iterations or timeout to recover from \"infinite loops\" in decision procedures.	We're paradox free because of the differing registers of both rational & irrational thinking we're capable of.
	The most simple example i can think of is the category mistake, a kind of fallacy.	This does not appear to be a kōan at all, but merely a story.
	Not necessarily tied to philosophy, but in formal debates the sides agree on a proposition to make arguments about.	\"Burden\" is an artificial construct: a notion of a social responsibility.
0.60	If a statement is not provable an inconsistency or self-contradiction may or will develop that invalidates the system.	Should arrival at this point be the focus for examination of any system?
	First of all, one needs to separate mathematical model from reality.	The question heading is understandable but I found the question body confusing.
	I gave this a lot of thought a few years ago and came up with a test.	I take the Google quote to be a jab at Russia in terms of homosexuality.
	I work in a quite technical field, that my wife knows nothing about.	I think the problem lies with the term \"some concept\".
	No measurement from inside the observed system can be informationally complete.	Godel's theorem I would like to pause here to first precisely state and prove the Godel theorem properly.
1.80	The Question is (from Hinduism); do you exist because of pregnancy?	The least that can be said is that we must be born with the ability and 'knowledge' to learn.
	let's see - God made human and able to improve it, people made computers and can improve them too.	We do not yet know whether the brain is \"understandable\" in the sense that we accept now.
	Marxist theory was developed in the 19th century by two German philosophers, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.	Yes, there does exist such a philosophical idea that radically changed the world in the twentieth century.
	Are we anthropormising the world when we incorporate cause & effect into our understanding of how the world acts?	The question you're asking is the main reason Kant wrote the Critique of Pure Reason.
	I don't know about Hinduism, but you jumped of the track right off the bat with Islam.	Point #1 - I only know a little about the Judeo-Christian-Islamic traditions that assume a moment of divine revelation.
	Off the top of my head, I think it's better to look at the criteria you've proffered for identifying \"God\".	A good argument I have seen against the existence of a God is based on Occam's Razor.
	The existence of different logics is interesting, but not particularly relevant, because of Gödel/Turing universality.	In today's mathematics, we have many variants of logic (propositional, first order, higher order, fuzzy logic, etc.).
	First, you've got to be more specific about the \"laws of physics\".	The answer is yes, no and maybe - the answer being dependent on whether one takes an empirical or philosophical perspective.
	Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder polarises opinion as it is a history of philosophy wrapped up in a children's story.	If you like reading you must check out Copleston's A History of Philosophy.
	\"God is exactly this Substance underlying who supports, exist independently of, and persist through time changes in material nature.	I'd argue that matter and energy are substances in the category of empirical scientific knowledge.
1.80	I think that for an understanding Wittgenstein's \"solution\", you must take in account the original (historical) context.	Wittgenstein is alluding to how Russell himself solved the Paradox - the theory of ramified types.
	This line of thought has a rich tradition in philosophy.	No, I don't think it is wise to see emotions and intelligence as algorithms.
1.20	Forget for a moment that you ever learned anything about so-called \"complex\" or \"imaginary\" numbers.	As others have already mentioned, numbers are of course abstractions.
0.00	The question of time is an incredibly difficult one, which has been treated of philosophers from Aristotle to Heidegger.	wikipedia, as much as it is a supposedly self correcting medium, is not necessarily a definitive account of anything.
	What you are asking about is the nature of causality, which is one of the stickiest problems in philosophy.	In \"ideal\" conditions, for example (warm temperature, moist environment, bacterial presence, etc), mold will grow on bread.
	Here is an example of philosophy helping a breakthrough in mathematics (in differential topology).	Do we expect musicians to have contributed to the state of the art of quantity surveying in the last 20 years?
	Discussions about the contingency of mathematical properties should definitely consider the existence of Non-standard Models (see the related MathOverflow reference request).	It depends on how you describe a mathematical object, and what you call \"a single\" mathematical object.
1.00	Not all negative claims can be validly reformulated into positive claims.	I don't think the burden of proof is on positive or negative versions.
	This is classic \"Nature versus Nurture\" debate, and if you study psychology you'll never hear enough of this.	Predestination: Religious arguments over predestination are useful here, along with more recent points about quantum mechanics and chaos theory.
	Our greatest asset For comparison, basically, human and animal have similar purpose in life, those are, survival and enjoyment.	Cicero's Hortensius, though effectively lost to us, appears to have been an answer to this very question.
	First, you must be using humanist in an idiosyncratic way.	If everyone can create \"meaning\" based on personal preference not some philosophical idea it will amount to contradiction.
	Most contemporary philosophers would interrogate the concept of happiness, pain, and even \"human nature\".	From a survival prospective, it is clearly not necessary to be happy to survive.
	I haven't read it myself, but I've heard good things about Delacampagne.	There is \"Philosophy in the Twentieth Century\" by Alfred Ayer which is quite good.
	This is much more a biology/evolution question than a philosophy question.	The answer is for at least this domain of problem is that prices are quantised and not continuous.
	People almost always have \"rational explanations\" for the things they do.	I don't think we can say anything about this case.
	They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.	Two components of just war theory come in to play when considering restrictions on liberty.
0.40	As I understand it, nothing that can be changed, or broken down into smaller parts is inherently real.	Our interactions are merely depends on where we put our perception.
	Knowledge, of the kind you're asking about, I think, usually requires evidence and reasoning.	Suppose I flip a coin and don't look at it.
	First, other sciences can have their concepts explained without math.	One way to think of mathematics is \"the study of patterns\"1.
	This varies depending on which logical system you're working in.	A syntactic proposition can be evaluated to be correct or not semantically via truth tables.
	\"How objects are named\" is something of a mystery to me.	The closest thing to the \"study of naming objects\" today, it seems, would be semiotics or semiology.
0.80	I can imagine a scenario where a single all powerful god create the universe that we know of.	It is the same idea as what Aristotle called the unmoved mover.
	The similiarity between Kant's and Wittgenstein's trains of thought has been expounded before for sure.	The question seems to presuppose contemporary sources are the best way in to philosophy.
	A more idiomatic paraphrase of ~(x)Bx is: not everything is a bird.	You've actually (perhaps unintentionally) asked a controversial question in the philosophy of logic.
	On a temporary basis and as an ongoing personal philosophy selflessness is possible but a consistent selfless life is unsustainable.	Anything we do based on our thinking and our emotions.
	This argument is about as sensible as saying that -1 is absurd because a negative apple doesn't and can't exist.	You overlook that human color experience is an overlay of the input of three color receptors.
	If not, what is preventing \"happiness\" from being quantified, in principle?	We use zero to represent a piece of information: that is, that there is zero of some collection.
	personally, i think u just identified one of philosophies greatest weakness, the lack of practical value.	Philosophy is one of many human endeavours to find a meaning in life, and universe, and so on.
	Nothing is very difficult to conceptualise - we only approach it by analogy.	The principle of sufficient reason states that nothing is without  reason, but why are there  any contingent truths?
	In Zen, validation occurs by recognition by a validated practitioner in a ceremony/event called Dharma Transmission.	Wikipedia does a good job of summarizing the four stages of enlightenment, which are stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and arahant.
	Interpreting infinity=0 mathematically is problematic for reasons that Niel de Beaudrap outlined.	Yes, there is at least one philosophical idea that addresses the uniqueness of Existence, infinity coming out from one (see e.g.
	They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.	There is not a single \"philosophical angle\" on this topic.
	Please see \"A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans\" with a theory of meaning by Jakob Von Uexkull.	Is it an acceptable idea that each individual carries their own model of reality in their mind?
	So, I will tailor my response to your comment to ChaosAndOrder.	Modal logic is an extension of classic propositional and predicate logic that allows the use of modal operators.
	From an atheist philosophical standpoint, how is existential contingency explained or accounted for?	My whole use of the word \"dream\" -- probably yours too!
	Read the paper Friederich Nietzsche and the seduction of Occam’s razor by Danesh-Meyer, Helen V.Young, Julian, 2010.	I've begun seeing Ockham's razor as being a statement about cognition and learning, and not about the construction of reality.
	Death penalty is a punishment, (in theory) reserved for the most heinous of crimes.	The way you stated your question, I'm not entirely clear what you are asking.
	His theorem applies to the way the mind works as well.	There is no reason that Human can't create machines as powerful as themselves.
	Zizek actually has touched this subject a couple of times.	I'd suggest that post-cold war Communism and Marxism no longer poses a threat, the Big Other is now Political Islam and/or terrorism.
	Expanding upon Joseph's comment: Special relativity rules out the possibility of absolute simultaneity.	For simultaneous events in different spatial locations see other replies.
	Download the reading Guide on logic books from http://www.logicmatters.net/students/tyl/ §1.2 gives recommendations for complete beginners.	This line of reasoning does contain the naturalistic fallacy: Monkeys are wild animals, and they live in the jungle.
	You might try Carnap's famous (but often neglected) Der logische Aufbau der Welt (The Logical Structure of the World).	One fixed static universal language would probably run into issues illustrated by Berry paradox and similar paradoxes.
	In Solipsism everyone else is a \"philosophical zombie\"; and all the time.	The Gödel–Cohen result establishes the independence of CH from ZF (with or without AC), not from any set theory whatsoever.
	Time is a physical factor and the term used to capture this concept is the word 'TIME'.	So in the Sanskrit language the time is synonym of death.
	will be supertrue (superfalse) iff under all (no) acceptable precisifications of the predicate \"bald\", the sentence comes out true.	Principle of Non-Contradiction:  \"A proposition p and its negation ~p cannot be true together.
	It seems that you are really asking what we mean by \"rational\".	Rational explanations follow from a specific set of axioms plus rules to go from step to step.
	You may find in recent philosophical letters (e.g., Collapse, in particular vol.	Fear is not quite a lack of control, but more a lack of knowledge.
3.00	When I needed a travel tripod, I also opted for a Trekpod.	An alternative tripod that may serve your needs is the TrekPod.
	I finally found one of the best astrophotography articles I've ever found on the net.	I am pretty new to the astrophotography scene but I have learned fairly quickly.
	To answer your question, yes, this is a design issue.	In answer to another question of mine, Matt Grum left a couple links that describe focus shift.
3.80	Fast Picture Viewer has an extensive pack for the low price of $9.99 and it appears to cover them all.	Fast Picture Viewer is $9.99 and works just fine on 64-bit Windows 7 (I'm using it myself).
3.20	There are many compact cameras with underwater housings available from Canon and Olympus.	There are waterproof compacts that go to 10 meters, such as some of the Olympus Tough models.
2.60	Apart from aperture and focal length, depth of field also decreases with camera-subject distance.	The wider your aperture, the smaller your focal depth will be.
	I can't speak for Canon cams, but in the Nikon world generally one should stick with Nikon brand batteries.	One of the easiest choices is to buy brand name batteries.
3.00	When printed on a lens the f-stop is usually expressed as a ratio with a colon (i.e.	It refers to the maximum f-stop (which is defined as the ratio of focal length to effective aperture diameter).
	The key is adding some specific tags every time you import.	I have a horrific naming scheme that renames based on EXIF taken date and the MD5 hash of the photo.
	Some of the newer point and shoots do great in manual mode.	I found that when I switched to a DSLR from a point-and-shoot digital, the quality of my photos improved dramatically.
	The interface between ACR and Photoshop has changed a couple of times over the years.	Adobe in their wisdom decided to force you to upgrade Photoshop if you splash out on a new camera model.
	A more expensive option is a remote trigger like the wireless pocket wizards and the cable for your camera.	I am very happy with the Phottix Plato it is a wireless solution that is cost effective.
	It is important to remember that RGB is an additive process, and CYMK is a subtractive process.	I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but I'll try and cover all the bases.
	There's no simple rule of thumb due to the inhearent nonlinearity in the equations.	Depth of field formulas are indeed complex and nonlinear, but they still afford useful rules of thumb.
	Although you could fix this problem in lightroom with reasonable results, you can fix it when taking the picture.	The old way of solving this problem, I mean before digital post-processing, was to apply foundation cosmetics on the model face.
	Ken Rockwell claims, and I agree, that the D5000 in quiet mode is pretty darn quiet.	From what I've read and seen, I don't think there is any real significant difference between 1.5 and 1.6.
	I used to think that blurring was one of those things that was impossible to recover from in post.	If the photo is blurred due to camera shake, you really don't have many options.
	If you took a look at the image that your camera initially takes, you'd be disappointed in it.	I may be wrong, but I don't think that what you are looking for is feasible.
	In my (admittedly limited) experience, in-lens stabilization (Nikon D90 + 18-200mm) works a lot better than in-body (Pentax K200D + 18-250mm).	Lenses are generally the most expensive part of photography equipment and likely to be kept longer than bodies.
	For what it's worth, dirt on the lens might not be as detrimental as you would think.	There's no \"right\" way to do this, it's what works best for you.
2.60	You need to be embedding a color profile in you image, as also using a browser that supports color management.	In my experience, when the final production will be in sRGB, use that color profile from start to finish.
	Firstly words, even technical terms, change meaning over time with usage.	The only construction-agnostic term would be long lens to compliment the other lens classes: wideangle and normal.
1.80	I have a few Nikon lenses, and a Sigma 10-20mm for super-wide shots.	If your interest is primarily the optics, you need to look at individual lenses, not brands as a whole.
	If you are looking for something that really won't move, I do recall of the Cotton Carrier line of products.	+1 for the Black Rapid series - I have one of those myself.
2.60	I have found there is no single best way to increase size.	There are a very wide variety of solutions for resizing and sharpening images for use on the web.
	The smaller the camera sensor size, the higher the crop factor, and thus the higher the effective focal length.	The greatest zoom range of any camera is the Canon Powershot SX30 IS.
	Use a large aperture (small F number) when you take a photo.	Apart from aperture and focal length, depth of field also decreases with camera-subject distance.
	You need either to remove the offending light or supply much more additional light to wash out the reflection.	You can't remove the reflections, but you can change what gets reflected.
	I simply got a refurbished older model point and shoot for my 5 year old.	It will really depend on how mature your kid is.
	Bokeh is a bit like evaluating wine, there's some technical evaluation and some subjective evaluation of it.	The areas which are out of focus are blurred in a shape matching that of the lens opening.
	Cleaning the glass is a great suggestion, however, even with clean glass you have a few more issues.	I can't speak directly to aquariums, however I've done shots at zoo's before.
	A Canon at 300ppi, you have the same tonal range as an Epson at 288ppi.	Emprical Study: Extreme digital upscaling For all of the theory above, thats all it currently is...theory.
	It simply means there are lots of pixels in your photograph at that brightness level.	If the histogram shows everything bunched up at one end, then have either a very dark or very light image.
	Shutter priority for shots that I want to control how much the action is frozen or blurred (panning).	I have my camera on P by default and switch to aperture priority when I care about depth of field.
0.80	I've used Paint Shop Pro and DxO Optics Pro on Windows.	In Linux I use Bibble, which is has some warts but which is the only serious option AFAICT.
	The only construction-agnostic term would be long lens to compliment the other lens classes: wideangle and normal.	Well, to use Wikipedia as well, it would appear that the options are telephoto and long focus lenses.
	Apart from dpreview.com, you can use Snapsort if you'd like something more flashy.	I'll second dpreview, they have very comprehensive reviews and as mentioned, the side-by-side comparisons are excellent.
1.60	A class 6 card in theory should be more than enough bandwidth for HD (1080) video for the 550D (48 MBit).	Some cards are too slow to accept an HD stream, so you need one that is fast enough.
	Bear in mind that the aperture will usually have to be set manually too.	Apart from aperture and focal length, depth of field also decreases with camera-subject distance.
	They could, on the other hand, more easily extend their own RAW format(s).	There is something particularly conceptually wrong with throwing away the stuff that comes out of your camera.
	Personally, I just guess, take a shot and look at my histogram and tweak as needed.	Its not linear, its a square,  so if you double the distance, you need 4 times the light.
	Aside from the better quality of the EF-S 10-22mm lens, it offers a significantly wider angle of view.	The 10-22mm lens is the perfect complimentary to the 18-55mm when it comes to nature and small room photography.
	Bibble Pro is a cross-platform program similar to Lightroom and Aperture.	There is UFRaw, which is based on dcraw and can be integrated with GIMP.
0.60	Here are many samples: Pbase.com Out of the 16k photos there, I'm sure some are with a d700.	It's a 1:1 lens, so that means that the size of the subject will be the same size on the sensor.
	There are literally dozens of tripods that can handle more than two pounds.	In general it is difficult to satisfy those 3 important properties at the same time: light weight, sturdiness, and cheap.
	The one clear benefit of digital that I see is the ability to emulate color filters in software.	The most obvious, and most distinct, difference will be cost.
	I second the approach of a standalone GPS Tracker and then using some software to sync it into your metadata.	Canon's official method is to use a gps unit with their Wireless File Transfer accessories.
	I would thoroughly recommend a read of Trey Ratcliff's excellent HDR tutorial.	The short answer is no it's not possible to create an HDR image from a single raw file.
	Depends on your budget obviously, but some cameras have dual card slots and can write identical files to both.	How about using an Apple iPad with the Camera Connection Kit accessory.
	I believe you're out of luck with IE, though perhaps that may get corrected in IE 9.	Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do that is practical.
2.60	Same here, I've the 50mm f/1.4, and as my fastest lens I couldn't live without it for concerts and low-light photography.	I have the 18-55, 50/1.8 and 50/1.4 as well as the 20D - superseded by a 50D.
1.20	I use Elinchrom Skyports, but if money is not an issue then go for PocketWizards.	Or just go with the ultra-cheap YongNuo RF-602, which give you a lot of bang for the buck.
	I had good luck switching the image into LAB mode, then adjusting the luminance layer only.	You can use fill light and reduced contrast to lift the shadows.
0.00	The short answer is that yes, you can do this.	Speaking from my own experience, I would rather carry different ND filters that combine two polarisers.
	There is no set rule for this; it all depends what you want to photograph.	A lot of the recommended sizes for different image types (2:3, 4:5) are based on the availability/cost of printing in those sizes.
	Well, I've searched for this for a good long while.	There is some discussion on Flickr here APS: Advanced Photo System.
	Dodge and Burn normally applies when you want to change the relative exposure of part of an image.	I like the way a burning vignette produces a more realistic result as opposed to a simple \"fade to black\".
	I'd go with the SD 1300, just check if you mother-in-law feels comfortable with its size.	It's very hard to buy a bad point-and-shoot at the moment.
	Photoshop Elements is $99 and is very close to Photoshop in terms of features for photographers but much cheaper.	The wider your aperture, the smaller your focal depth will be.
	The most important fact - which is buried in one of the previous responses - is focus speed.	Stabilization is primarily intended to help when your shutter speed is less than the reciprocal of your focal length.
	To follow up on Genius' reply, DP Review had a Waterproof Camera Group Test last year.	I got my young daughter a cheap Olympus Stylus Tough 6000.
	They could, on the other hand, more easily extend their own RAW format(s).	Another advantage is that the manufacturer's raw files are better supported by post-processing software.
	Chinon CEII that My Dad gave me as a student.	A Nikon EM, sort of a point-and-shoot beginner's SLR, that I got in high school (way back when ... mid 80s?).
	Nick Miners.com Nick is a friend of mine who posts articles on his blog covering a range of photography topics.	Chase Jarvis is an excellent resource for pro behind-the-scenes stuff, lots of excellent material available as a podcast.
	I don't know about nikon, but I did the same thing on the Canon side.	I believe that the 70-200 accepts a few specific 1.4x TCs quite well.
2.40	The terminology is usually called \"Destructive vs Non Destructive\" editing.	Lossless / nondestructive edits are reversible and would entail transforming and/or appending the data in a way that could be reversed.
	Use a high speed page feed scanner like the DR-2010C from Canon.	Another suggestion: wait until you have money to throw at the problem.
	You can use free, open-source utility Exiftool to extract the metadata from the JPG files.	Why not stop using JPEG images and use RAW exclusively?
	Two things need to be considered here: focusing speed and adequate sensitivity to light to achieve a fast shutter speed.	Often a faster lens will be sharper even at the same aperture as a cheaper lens.
	I think this is an example of: use the opportunities you have, rather than the ones you wish you had.	Polarizers and neutral density filters will go a long way to help this, but they are not a panacea.
	There's really only one thing you need to memorize and it's easy: a list of standard f-stops in graduations of one f-stop (1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45, 64, 90).	For the exposure, you can try an analog light-meter, like the Gossen Lunasix.
	I upgraded from 400D to 7D and things just got sharper (and you should expect the same).	It has to do with the sensor size - large sensors require correspondingly larger lenses.
	Reid is right - that VR does not help at all in stopping motion.	Completely agree with Reid... in this situation a fast prime is the way to go.
	In short: you can enlarge it as much as you like.	That all depends on the viewing distance, and, to a lesser degree the brand, age and speed of the film.
	If you can find a used 7d I'd jump on it, but chances are, you won't at a price oyu'll like.	\"Background compression\" is part of how we perceive perspective in a photograph.
	There are numerous kinds of optical abberations that you may encounter with a lens.	I'm trying to write down a more photographer oriented answer.
	Sometimes the amount of exposure compensation available (ie +/- 2 stops) in Aperture priority mode might simply not be enough.	Manual mode can give you more consistent metering when you're taking several photos in a scene.
	The camera will only ever do a \"quick format\" as there is a limit on read/write operations on flash memory.	I format my card every time I stick it in my camera and start a shoot.
	I have the 35mm 1.8 and the 50mm 1.4 - and for people wanting thier 1st fixed prime I always point them at the 35mm 1.8 1st.	Only when we consider all these factors do we come up with a 'normal' focal length value of about 50mm.
0.40	For what it's worth, dirt on the lens might not be as detrimental as you would think.	Regular dish washing fluid is great for removing grease, as it not only dissolves it but also binds it.
	Polarizers do block light, as they are designed to filter out light coming from certain directions.	Aside from focal length, the most important thing to consider is the maximum aperture of the lens.
	If you're not feeling the limitations of your point-and-shoot camera, then you probably don't need a DSLR.	They aren't better per se; They just tend to allow greater artistic control over the result.
	If you are a member of Costco, their prints are great.	They're not the cheapest, but the quality is superb, so I'm a fan of WHCC.
	I don't bracket with digital unless I'm blending multiple exposures to get greater dynamic range.	I highly recommend building into your gestalt a certain bat sense about when to use bracketing.
	Definitely shoot in AV (aperture value) mode and vary the shutter speed!	Well part of sunset photography IS luck with the elements.
	I know you asked for free stuff, however given that I whole-heartedly agree with Reid about how valuable your time is.	Pisca provides basic photo editing tools (crop and colour and level adjustments) as well as good EXIF tagging.
0.60	Large-format cameras are very much worth buying used; they're often extremely well-cared-for, if not coddled.	If I had to pick, Linhof would be my choice.
	Basically, you must understand three settings: Film speed, aperture size, shutter speed.	The best way to learn is to start photographing more — both for the basics and for more advanced photography.
	Most dancefloor lights are tungsten, so unless you're using flash you should be okay with that.	I shoot in raw on auto-wb, and then adjust to taste in the raw processor.
	Adobe Photoshop Elements is actually a pretty good package these days.	There are quite a few alternatives, depending somewhat on what you're after.
	The exposure settings to stop moving objects depends entirely on how fast the objects are traversing your frame.	Most important:  put your camera down for a while and make a snowman!
	First of all, what you have is probably mirror pre-fire rather than a true mirror lockup.	Mirror lockup is used to reduce vibrations with longer exposures.
	If you're primarily interested in video, the Nikon option offers 1080p and 24 frames per second with autofocus.	I'd recommend reading an article from Philip Bloom, a professional filmmaker who uses DSLRs on a daily basis.
	If the photo is blurred due to camera shake, you really don't have many options.	Well as nobody has posted anything yet I thought I'd cheekily point you in the direction of my own blog.
1.00	Anil, there certainly is a difference in results, mainly in image quality.	If you want to learn photography, almost any camera will do to start with.
	I just found a page that has some information about this.	Hold your camera close to your body... stand with your elbows bent and your arms against your sides.
	Most digital cameras use a 10 to 14-bit A/D converter, and so their theoretical maximum dynamic range is 10-14 stops.	There is an easy trick: \"measure\" for yourself: take your camera.
	Understanding Exposure by Bryan Peterson is a great and easy to read book that covers these topics.	If you own Adobe Photoshop, you should get \"The Photoshop Book for Digital Photographers\", also by Kelby.
2.60	Freezing motion generally requires one, maybe two things: fast shutter speed, and flash at the right time.	In addition to @Pearsonartphoto's answer, you can use flash (either the built-in or better yet, an extarnal) to freeze the motion.
	I'm a bit biased, but you might find my site, Snapsort useful.	Pogue on the Canon s95: http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/a-love-letter-to-a-camera/ I think he likes it.
	The answer is No, since Russia is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council.	There's no such thing as misuse of the veto right in the Security Council.
4.00	Federal DOMA does not test the full faith and credit clause so much as the 9th and 10th Amendments to the Constitution.	DOMA as a congressional statute could not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution.
3.60	Public employees can unionize because the law allows them to.	The legal reasons why public employees can unionize have been elsewhere described.
	There are two challenges to online voting which can be seen as well technological as cultural.	The largest barrier to online voting is ensuring that fraud does not occur.
2.60	The U.S. appears to have a smaller shadow economy for a few reasons in no particular order.	There are three main factors that drive the low shadow economy in the US.
	The United States has had a constant 435 members in the House of Representatives since the Reapportionment Act of 1929.	Analysing the number of representatives in various countries, that number is in no direct proportion to the countries' population.
1.60	Leaving aside heath care angle, you are working from a flawed premise that waging war doesn't save lives.	Healthcare They would probably reject your implied claim that Obama's healthcare law will save lives.
	The following is a synopsis and explanation of common beliefs the Libertarian free market philosophy.	Even the largest corporations (e.g., Walmart) are subject to competition, which is a key component of the libertarian philosophy.
	\"opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution\".	As they contribute to the federal budget they do also receive help from it.
4.00	The president is not really all that important for German people.	The function of the german president is almost just representative.
	Executive orders are not permanent, they exist at the will of the president and can be changed at any time.	Congress tends to pass bills with language explicitly giving the president discretion over certain matters.
	There are 2 problems with the viewpoint you presented in the question, which explain the seeming contradiction.	First, I think you do mean the Republican Party and not conservatism.
3.00	In a \"first-past-the-post\" system, it is difficult to sustain more than two parties.	While the 'first-past-the-post system favours two parties, it certainly doesn't guarantee the marginalization of third parties.
	Great Britain is used to formally refer to the UK (including Northern Ireland) in a number of international associations.	People use Great Britain, at least in my encounters, to talk about England proper (i.e.
	Most democratic countries have a written constitution, but it's not a requirement.	No, there are some that have none, but they are pretty rare.
	The legal reasons why public employees can unionize have been elsewhere described.	Public sector employees can currently unionize because President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order  10988.
	Over time, Parliament (the Lords and Commons) took more and more power from the monarch.	The checks and balances of the UK parliamentary system are very different from the US, but they do exist.
	They WERE called \"freedom fighters\" in the West through 1980s when they were fighting the USSR.	They are called \"terrorists\" because they engage in what is commongly understood to be acts of terrorism.
	Legal case information is generally easy to come by if you poke around a bit.	They are called \"terrorists\" because they engage in what is commongly understood to be acts of terrorism.
0.60	The part of economics that is most like physics is called microeconomics.	Side note first: I don't think that physicists always agree on their theories and predictions.
	Yes it is technically possible that a BUK system shot down the plane.	This is a VICE news clip of a Ukrainian military AN-26 transport shot down a few days before MH-17.
	\"Teabagging\" is when a male dips his scrotum upon another person's face as an insult.	\"Teabagger\" is yet another shining example of \"civil discourse\" by left wingers in America.
	Some lobbying comes in the form of giving campaign contributions to politicians.	The problem with the lobbying is that people choose their representatives to represent the interests of the voters.
	Being left or right were obvious when being right was being for monarchy and being left was being for republic.	The crisis is one of the biggest fact that have increased the nationalisms in the politic field.
	tl;dr: If non-dictatorial communist societies existed, then not for long.	The democratic election of Communist Salvador Allende in Chile in 1970 represented an \"experiment\" in democratic Communism.
	Simply, it was not well thought out, and the \"unintended consequences\" are now revealing themselves.	This answer is based on the response in the comment clarifying the question.
0.00	Let me share my opinion as Ukrainian citizen, from Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine.	I am sure this is more phylosophical and ethical question than it seems.
	Nowhere does it say that a naturalized citizen has the same privileges as a natural-born citizen.	The 14th Amendment extends equal protection to all citizens, natural born or naturalized, so that no state can abridge their rights.
0.40	Most people want not only to be WELL off, but to become BETTER off as time goes by.	To start, the main drivers of economic growth are resources, technology, and institutions.
	When having discussions on Anarchist/Anarcho-capitalist forums, I've come across this issue a couple times.	In an Anarchy, quarreling parties would be unrestricted to come to a lawful agreement.
	First, They already have, that is part of the reason for the conflict in the first place.	In addition to all the OTHER answers, another reason is the sheer difficulty.
	The Vice President is elected because it is constitutionally required, as per the 12th amendment.	The original conception of the US presidency was very different than it is today.
	So do they basically stop paying their vendors such as the electric company or rent on buildings?	What money are the using to pay down the debt?
0.40	I'm not yet able to answer if the phenomenon has an official PoliSci name.	There are 2 problems with the viewpoint you presented in the question, which explain the seeming contradiction.
	Let me make something incredibly clear up front: While I come across as rather angry, I'm not.	It's a mixed / hybrid goverment, integrating elements from almost every one of the basic forms of government.
	These are generically called nomination rules; the US calls them ballot access rules.	In the originally-envisioned system, Presidential electors are appointed by the states; the states decide how those electors are chosen.
2.00	No, nothing in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act grants the President transitional authority.	There is always \"transitional authority\" by virtue of the writing of regulations.
	Federal DOMA does not test the full faith and credit clause so much as the 9th and 10th Amendments to the Constitution.	Congress does not have to currently justify the laws it passes.
	Both of your bullet points are correct, and both are wrong.	The democratic election of Communist Salvador Allende in Chile in 1970 represented an \"experiment\" in democratic Communism.
	In German, the term \"Nahost\" or \"Naher Osten\" (near East) are in common use.	The term Far East usually refers to East Asia, including Mongolia, China, Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia.
	In Lebanon (and in some other places) 'Christian' is as much an ethnic and cultural as a religious designation.	Christians and muslims in Lebanon both are separated internally in their political point of view toward Syria.
	While these criteria are normative, there are solidly defended norms out there for these meanings.	During the French revolution the most radical politics were sitting on left site, the most conservative on the right.
	Wikipedia has a short list of articles about LGBT groups and individuals opposed to same-sex marriage.	Wikipedia has a good breakdown of the different flavors of this argument in this article.
	Some of the gap could be attributed to social issues, but that may not account for the entire gap.	Biology In the modern Western world, males have a lower life expectancy for two important biological reasons.
	One has to separate out two elements of this - first is 'voter' and second is the difference between 'knowledge' and 'interest'.	Congress tends to pass bills with language explicitly giving the president discretion over certain matters.
	The Jerusalem is a holy place for both Muslims and Jews.	You are correct that the Israeli-Arab conflict has not resulted in nearly so much death as ongoing conflicts in Africa.
	Equality is widely accepted because it can mean so many different things to so many people.	Many times we judge the plausibility of a theory based on it's outcomes.
	After posting this question, I received the February 1st - 7th edition of the Economist.	There have been several studies, most of which have found no movement in class mobility over the past several decades.
	I think the best way address your question(s) is by using a legal analysis.	\"To put it succinctly, Hamas is using its own citizens in the Gaza strip as shields.
	The word \"libertarianism\" was essentially invented because classical liberals felt that the word had become expropriated.	First of all, as usual in politics, you got definition confusions galore.
	I would rather have added this as comments to the question and to NL7 answer but do not have the reputation..	This touches on a foundational question of political philosophy and international relations: peace & trade versus war & plunder.
	Probably the best measure of a candidates ideology is the DW NOMINATE score.	As he's a member of the Republican party, that'd make him a Republican.
	What troubles most people about same-sex and sibling marriages is their likely impact on childbearing.	I think the best way address your question(s) is by using a legal analysis.
	One result, perhaps unintended of the split between the Senate and the House is that they have rather different constituencies.	The U.S. Congress didn't actually start out bicameral; the original Articles of Confederation (the pre-Constitution) had a single house.
	The holocaust took place to some extent within Germany, and German Jews/gypsies/homosexuals were taken to extermination camps.	An important factor is the posture of German versus Japanese leaders.
	Well when it comes to a Developing Country there wouldn't be a huge impact.	I would like to share a link to League of Nations as an example.
0.60	Russian Federal Law is actually quite specific on this one and not as arbitrary as argued.	The last round of presidential elections in Russia was held on March 4th, 2012 and December 4th, 2011 for the Duma.
	When having discussions on Anarchist/Anarcho-capitalist forums, I've come across this issue a couple times.	I often like to point to the workers councils of Hungary in October–December 1956 as a \"pre-figurative\" form of life without a state.
	To make a tactical vote, you need an estimate how much votes each candidate is probably going to get.	Let us first ask what are the implications of tactical voting?
0.00	This question has already been widely discussed and answered on Skeptics.	Minimum wage laws hurt the least skilled, least productive the most.
3.20	According to Shia Muslims specially Iran state and Hezbollah a country called Israel does not exist.	As with the definition of Palestine, the definition of Israel varies depending on whom you ask.
	Whenever you hear about \"politicians receiving money from corporations\" It almost always refers to campaign contributions rather than personal gifts.	The justification is likely personal and wide ranging across the political spectrum.
	You are asking a fairly broad question, so I need to tackle a few points before answer it directly.	Basic Income is often held up as the method to deal with widespread unemployment as a result of mass automation.
	They do it for the same reason why some stadiums sell their good tickets by lottery.	At least in the case of H1-B visas, the annual quota is typically exhausted within a week.
	I disagree that there's \"no other choice\" than to be funded by public organizations.	I wish to provide an answer with a concrete example of why funding pure mathematics is a fruitful endeavor.
	I am from Hungary and I looked for hungarian source of Poland, polish and other keywords on Jobbik website.	All translations mistakes are mine, so don't judge the sources based on possibly poor use of English.
	The Federal Reserve has been conducting Open Market Operations for many decades; the law was passed in 1913.	Can the Fed choose not to claim securities that they are holding, that are due?
	In the election of 1872, Grant easily beat Horace Greely, 286 to what would have been 66 votes for Greely.	It's essentially a remnant from a time when the U.S. political system worked differently.
	Both of your bullet points are correct, and both are wrong.	It's not possible to be politically neutral, though one should always strive to be objective.
	In theory, that would be the case if all workers were equal.	Total Expense 8000 After limit company has 100 workers making 10/hour for 6 hours producing 700 units.
	Border Issue: There is certainly a border issue between India and Bangladesh.	Ultimately, the answer is that the Archivist of the United States gets to decide what \"ratified\" means.
	As you see, the answers and comments here also contradict each other.	There were absolutely no articles, blogs, or studies that I could find that suggested causation at all.
	Most political ideologies are in favor of restricting the behavior and thoughts of just about everybody, young and old.	Legal drinking age of 21 is quite extreme of USA, compared with legal age for having sex as little as 15 AFAIK.
	As Michael WS points out, a 'first past the post' system (which the US has) encourages a two party system.	The two party system is reflective of our system of voting.
	\"Teabagger\" is yet another shining example of \"civil discourse\" by left wingers in America.	(I'll try and post a less overtly biased and editorialized answer.
	Many countries significantly reduced their debt by defaulting on it.	One of the provisions that the US made under the Articles of Confederation was the Land Ordinance of 1785.
	In short, you can't because the Supreme Court has recognized the Right to Lie.	As much as I'm for honesty, such a system would probably be untenable.
	The government can't force a business to act, but they can punish them for not acting.	Simply put, this is exactly the question that Elaine Photography is going to decide.
	The reason it changed is the term \"liberal,\" suffered too much damage to it's brand, particularly during the years Pres.	Liberal: using existing laws and government to do good for everyone.
	The entire social contract tradition on which most modern forms of government are based depends on equality of certain rights.	Many times we judge the plausibility of a theory based on it's outcomes.
	At a very simple level, the answer is that not all rights are financial.	I see only benefits of such a system without any major drawbacks in the long run.
	Crimea is a very fertile agricultural region, and is often seen as a vacation spot for Russians.	A good example of what you are looking for is from the City & County of San Francisco.
	Your forgetting the most dangerous criminals, the trained professionals, the law enforcement officers.	Police aren't omnipresent, and you can't just instantly summon them upon demand.
2.80	Because there are more effective ways for Her Majesty to change or veto laws.	They do not veto laws because nobody will ever adopt a law which is contrary to the expressed queen's will.
2.60	Absolute majority always defined by the institution, or the context.	In countries like India, when you have 2/3 of the seats of all parliament, you have absolute majority.
	Hospitals are legally bound to stabilize a patient, but that is all; so many life-saving operations still will not be performed.	The first statement is largely true, and the second one is largely false.
	The French constitution of 1946 (Fourth Republic) established proportional representation (at the level of each departement).	I'm not quite sure what the question here is, but I'll give it a shot.
	Inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth.	The standard terms of left and right politics originate from the seating arrangement of the French National Assembly of 1789.
2.80	Professor Burkhauser has done extensive research on who is hurt by higher minimum wages.	Minimum wage laws hurt the least skilled, least productive the most.
	The Nazi party was called Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers' Party).	I think this question illustrates that a simple division of politics in left and right is an oversimplification.
	Well, there is distinction between extremist party and an anti-democratic party.	The democracy is based on the principle of the freedom of expressing one's thoughts, both individually and in groups.
	In Massachusetts, you walk into the polling place and state a name and home address belonging to a registered voter.	How do states without Voter ID laws ensure that people are who they say they are?
	In a roundabout way, there's some truth to that statement, though it's a bit more nuanced than that.	What your friend told you likely stems from comments made by our current Attorney Genrral, Eric Holder.
	The democratic election of Communist Salvador Allende in Chile in 1970 represented an \"experiment\" in democratic Communism.	It's not possible to be politically neutral, though one should always strive to be objective.
0.20	The University constituencies are modelled on the University constituencies in use in Britain in 1922 when Ireland became independent.	This is still a representational form of gov't, but with a unique twist.
	In the age of Empire, these were totally different things.	These terms seem to be used interchangably - by whom and where?
	There are conflicting philosophies and approaches to this (and frankly, no good or clear answer).	Trying to look at 'all of humanity' or 'what's best for Germany' aren't useful questions.
	The government can't force a business to act, but they can punish them for not acting.	The rights / protected classes you are talking about are equal protection issues, which fall under the 14th Amendment.
	This question can only be answered within a theoretical context.	Basically Electoral institutes are responsible for conducting the polls as per the present rule and regulations.
	One argument sometimes made against federally recognized civil unions by anti-gay-marriage side is actually purely political.	The problem is that there's no free dinner and someone pays for those benefits (see http://www.expatica.com/de/finance_business/tax/-Tax-saving-possibilities-for-employees-in-Germany_17099.html for example).
3.20	Before you want to start the study of a subject, figure out what you want to achieve.	As Eugene suggests, try to figure out what you want to achieve.
	Inbox Zero means what it says: nothing what so ever is left in your in box.	It means nothing in the inbox is on your mind.
	I would suggest starting from ActiveInbox (used to be GTDInbox) and see whether that fully covers your needs.	I'd suggest using Gmail's integrated task manager (Google Tasks) rather than labels.
	To me, the effectiveness of my system relates to my long, mid-range, and short term goals.	Try to look at existing time management systems rather than starting from scratch and trying to reinvent the wheel.
0.60	Eclipse Below are list of eclipse shortcuts which I use almost everyday.	To train yourself to use keyboard shortcuts, unplug your mouse for a few days.
3.60	As others have mentioned, the iRobot Roomba is an excellent example of a household robot which does meaningful work.	I've been happy with the iRobot Roomba for floor cleaning.
	Thinking on your feet is an essential skill for combat soldiers.	Mostly it's about getting over your fear of answering incorrectly.
0.00	The important thing I try to remember is just to pay attention.	I have been reading on this topic since I have asked this question.
	I think just the typical kitchen timer is the best investment you can get (for a physical device).	I purchased a timer at Bed Bath & Beyond that has three separate timers and an overall timer/clock.
	There are several ways to tackle this and it partly depends on the system you're using.	Under GTD, you need to think whether that's actually an action or a (mini-)project.
	Use a firm sturdy chair like a kitchen table chair instead of an office chair.	Buy a knee chair or one of these large balls to sit on.
	The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo and is aimed at establishing a standard to measure productivity.	Stephen Covey, although also considered a management guru, is definitely one of the most well-known and sold personal productivity authors.
	After your meeting, try to find a picture of them on the internet.	With any activity that you would like to make routine, there are three things you need to know.
	I think the hesitation comes from the fear that you will not be productive during the session.	I get started by telling myself that I do not intend to finish whatever I'm sitting down to work on.
	There is not really anything you can do besides being a witness; just try to get over it.	I have not noticed my other family members having the same degree of sensitivity.
	I've learned over the years that Association is the key!	I have a Nook Color and I think it is GREAT!!!!!!
	I've found that usually when I'm being introverted or quiet it's because I'm thinking mostly about myself.	I think it's better to forget you're an introvert or the word introvert.
0.00	I think you need to apply a little statistical thinking to this.	One general key to not feeling dejected is to avoid comparing yourself to others.
	You're right, someday/maybe vs actionable is an artificial distinction that induces mental resistance during the classification process.	Someday/Maybe items are things that you can't or don't need to do right now.
	What folders you need depends a bit on your email client's capabilities, and how you want to work.	Just your inbox and one other folder for holding emails until they are to be acted upon.
	What I do is wake up early (around 6) and run for a while.	Note that there are many medical reasons that could be the cause of excessive sleeping and extreme fatigue.
0.00	A quick research (1, 2) showed me that the concentration of caffeine seems to peak about 30-60mins after ingestion.	The issue is that it never becomes useful in its true meaning.
	So consider the idea that it might be your body trying to tell you something...	Your mention of the weather changes brings two thoughts to mind.
0.00	Here's a technique  I've developed without being aware of it: Multiple Browsers.	I agree with others that tracking your time is fundamental to the solution.
	Try Any.Do, apart from everything you want, it also has the ability to drag and drop tasks to organize them.	Try Wunderlist - it's got all of the features you're asking.
2.20	I have a standing/sitting desk at work and really like it.	As mentioned by other responders, it turns out that using a standing desk isn't necessarily a perfect solution.
	I used to struggle with the same desires for adventure, novelty and risk-taking.	You should break you comfort zone, if you wanna try something new.
0.00	Even though the question has been answered I would like to add my answer .	I don't know if I should say this, but if your job is making you anxious.
	The second option is more realistic unless the book doesn't have many pages.	Actually, David Allen defines a tasks as to long/complex when your can't motivate yourself for that task.
	I get started by telling myself that I do not intend to finish whatever I'm sitting down to work on.	This has to do with having discipline to do something everyday.
	I think this is a more sophisticated version of the questions we often get on gamification.	A nice article on flow in the workplace: http://www.fastcompany.com/53713/art-work It's not easy, though.
	when I am pretty excited about learning the stuff) I sit down for studying I find myself browsing irrelevant websites!	If you're reading books on programming, of course you'll get bored!
	Bento can handle relationships, but I don't think it can do what you're asking it to do.	You want the closest thing to Bento, running on Windows (or Linux) ... FileMaker Pro?
	The thing I like about Evernote is that this is all they do (for now).	Google keep is only Android and web, as far as I know.
	Structured procrastination gives some amazing tipps to trick yourself into doing something.	One of the great ways when working on large tasks is to break it in manageable bits.
	The #1 skill as all of us \"intermediate\" and \"advanced\" users know, is how to web search properly.	This may be kind of out of point but I felt you might need this advice.
	The main app I use specifically for this is Daytum.	Massive ulterior motive alert but this sounds perfect for Beeminder.
	By definition productivity is measured by calculating the total output per unit of total input.	The Pomodoro Technique consists basically in working continuously in blocks of time, which are usually predetermined in 25 minutes.
	Let's Do This is the simplest, easiest, and best looking way to manage your daily to do list.	I use one called Weave, and I found it very helpful.
0.40	Your brain is already beginning to wind down as you see the end in sight.	I'm writing here a few tips that can help you with motivation.
	Try Anki : http://ankisrs.net/ I hope it is the software you need.	I recently found an app called Memonote that is definitely worth looking at.
	Stephen Covey speaks about this topic in his book \"Seven habits of highly effective people\", in the chapter \"Be proactive\".	Don't pressurize yourself to stop the emotions immediately, be easy with them.
	I think the answer from Brian almost says it all.	It takes me a while to get somethings that others get quickly.
	Wisdom says broken heart is cured by another heart -- a new love definitely gets you over break-ups.	3 years that is quite some time, but throw away everything that reminds you of her.
	I have been there too and I have managed to solve these issues by taking away the origin.	The language you are using appears to me to be limiting your choices.
0.00	To stick with the traditional pomodoro technique this is considered an interruption.	There is actually functionality in most browsers already in place to do just this.
	Some years ago I read that one standard deviation in IQ (~15 IQ points) increased productivity by 1.6 times.	I may have found some weak evidence that they are negatively correlated.
	Try to apply what you learn by implementing a small project, don't just read.	I'd recommend looking into \"The First 20 Hours\" by Josh Kaufman.
	I'm going to be very short: you should set a singular purpose (goal) for yourself.	I'm asking for some resources (books, websites, etc) or personal advice that would help me overcome this situation.
	I'm writing here a few tips that can help you with motivation.	You are incorrect when you say these aren't \"important\" when in reality it is important since it annoys you.
	I find that a good strong espresso will give me a buzz within a few minutes.	A quick research (1, 2) showed me that the concentration of caffeine seems to peak about 30-60mins after ingestion.
	I tried listening to music also, but after some time your ears get hurt and that's disturbing.	From my experience the noise-cancelling headphones will not work for longer periods.
	Self-discipline is good to a certain degree, but overdoing it can be counter-productive.	I'm assuming you finish your share of work before starting any entertaining activity.
2.60	I think 90 days is the absolute most you can plan out in a single time period.	Definitely plan a month ahead - it's totally OK for your plans to change - just amend them as they do.
	I bought \"Typequick\" and set aside a practice time everyday for about a month.	Just do a lot of programming and you'll pick it up over time.
	Mendeley is a free alternative to Evernote (but they also have a Pro plan for more features).	I would suggest using  Zotero, I created a Zotero folder \"to-read\" to pile up the pending papers.
	What you really need is a long term goal, not a morning routine.	This will be your cue to start the difficult part.
	I recently read that a simple short-term change of the environment you work in actually helps to revive your energy.	Sometimes you do just need to switch off and do something else.
	This may not be the software that your looking for but this has the functionality that you need.	Assistant Professor Matt Might recommends using separate devices for those activities that do not directly contribute to work.
0.80	The user needs to evaluate for his/herself the cost/benefit of an \"obvious\" efficiency tool, such as macros.	Instead of trying to force specific answers or method's on them.
	I study in a university and live in its hostel.	Another alternative is to take notes on what you are reading.
	So do you have a procrastination or an energy problem?	I also like GTD, but the name can be a bit misleading.
	Slightly funny but the internet meme \"Asian Father\" could be a satirical example.	Name: Santa Claus Job position: CEO of a secret NGO belived to be somewhere near North Pole.
	Prioritization and keeping distractions away are good but these are not the key abilities.	Give yourself a time limit during which it is forbidden to do anything else.
	Our body's sleep patterns respond to light by production of serotonin and melatonin.	I have to agree with pretty much all the above, but it mostly comes down to what your limits are.
0.40	I like the previous answers regarding setting a schedule and fulfilling the rituals of going to a job.	Buy a 3 panel screen and use it to separate the work area from the sleeping area.
3.00	I'd start by reading David Allen's book: Getting Things Done.	I'm considering spending the $48 per month on the GTD (Getting things done) system advertised by David Allen.
	Your objective is to find someone who wants to buy your products.	The action that your employer is asking you to take is completely within the normal duties in your sector.
2.20	The best way to clear your head after a study session is by taking on a vigorous physical exercise (min.	What works for me is to switch the subjects and take frequent breaks.
0.60	I disagree with Josh Bruce on some of his tips.	Research does indicate that sleeping after studying is a pretty good rule-of-thumb.
3.40	Currently I've got a fairly close to purely digital GTD setup, although this could do with some refinements and tweaks.	My GTD system is effectively 100 percent electronic--as described in detail here.
	Part of the answer, at least, is that some people just can't do it.	As a software developer myself, I am doing this right now.
	First of all, if you are not familiar with GTD, I'd encourage you to read up on the literature.	I suggest looking into the book \"The Now Habit\" by Neil Fiore.
	Simplest way ... Our brain has to be use too with any thing around the world.	You might enjoy the book Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactoring Your Wetware by Andy Hunt.
2.20	Feel the fear... And do it anyway The book recommends to feel the fear.	13 Tips To Face Your Fear and Enjoy the Ride seems interesting.
	RTM is simply ninja for implementing a tickler file, so if you use Remember the Milk you're all set.	I use two methods, depending on whether the thing I'm being tickled about is part of a project or stand-alone.
	I use a trackball mouse controlled by thumb, so my experience may be different.	I used a Kensington Pro Mouse ($120 at the time) for about 8 years until it croaked a few months ago.
	Every human being has an observation skill and they can improve it with time.	I am adding another answer as I stumbled today across a quite contrasting opinion.
	I can speak from my current situation that people are, without question, more productive when a window view is available.	I think your issue is calling out for some type of breathing exercise or meditation.
	Personally I use mindmapping technique in order to summarize/outline/remember every topic I deal with.	You could consider exploring what are the ways things tend to stick for you.
	Earplugs will muffle a good portion of sound if it is around normal voice level.	Make her a deal where you throw away the TV but she gets something else in return.
	I've been suffering the same problem for the last few years without realizing it.	You've got to find what you love - I'm borrowing this opinion by someone who was very successful, Steve Jobs.
	For me, it also works to start with easy to achieve goals, like: focus on specific task for 10 minutes.	This reminds me the Penn&Teller episode on 12 step programs.
1.80	I've recently bought two sit/stand Galant tables from IKEA and I'm quite happy with them.	http://www.varidesk.com/ There is also the hand-made/DIY version for which you could obtain design templates for.
	So, in another words, how can get into a state of concentration, faster.	A long term solution is to increase the interest in the subject you want to flow with.
	Dou you really want these kind of people in your team?	I think it was Fiore in \"The Now Habit\" that talked about so-called \"positive\" effects that end up reinforcing procrastination.
	So how do you improve your productivity as a programmer?	http://www.topcoder.com - This is a good site to understand where we stand as developers.
	Needing multiple levels of tasks seem more like project management.	Wunderlist has local programs and a web only version that also has apps available (iOS and Android).
	Co-founders are already given lots of incentives in the form of money and acknowledgement.	It sounds like you're running a startup business together, although you don't explicitly state this.
	Something I have been taught while studying English and then preparing for tests/exams like IELTS which may be of help here.	I'm sure others will post fancier responses here, but I really think this one is pretty simple.
	Amazon allows any Kindle user to set up an email address (username@kindle.com) which you can email documents to.	The Calibre eBook management application can do exactly this and more.
0.80	I would say the best thing for me is to have a proper and consistent sleep schedule.	There's also FreakyAlarm for iOS, which makes you solve simple logic/math problems before the alarm will turn off.
	It's a subjective question but In my opinion, people should clean their inbox tasks before sleeping.	I clean as I go using this flowchart: Is it actionable?
	I think that your experiment shows exactly how important self confidence for productivity is.	There are lots of specific, measurable and achievable things in life--lots of them aren't worth doing.
	Blogging about what you're learning about is so completely useful.	I would like to hear perspectives from others on this since I've not yet gotten around to trying it myself.
	I would suggest doing a thorough and honest evaluation of your time.	Why not just pick a regular schedule of where you'll work, and when?
	As the development usually requires a \"peaceful mind\", I leave it to the end of the day.	This varies from person to person, or even through different corporate cultures/job enjoyment.
0.00	Some studies suggest open-space environments lower working efficiency with 2-10% due to interruptions, stress and noise.	There's an iPhone app called Groups which might be helpful.
1.60	Experience: you must have noticed in you project/office that other colleagues who are more experience understand things quickly.	I think a learning attitude is the founding skill of a self-taught person.
	Check out these two resources on learning while sleeping http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2012/06/experiments-show-we-really-can-learn-while-we-sleep/ http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=some-skill-sleep-learning-may-work-12-06-25 Apparently it is possible.	Work in the smallest of steps that allow you to make progress.
2.80	There is a relatively narrow set of people who are eligible to be wandering in the restricted areas.	The capital severely punishes people who head out to the restricted areas (e.g.
1.67	I disagree that the moniker “most extensive” should be applied to Dorothy Jones Heydt’s language.	The most extensive Vulcan language was made by fans in the 60's, especially by linguist Dorothy Jones Heydt.
	I had always thought she was the daughter of a Daniel the 7th cylon.	I've always figured she was the same thing that Head Six and Head Baltar were.
	There are many races in the Star Trek universe that are so near-human there may be no discernible difference.	Humans in the Star Trek universe are expansionistic, not self-destructive, and breed easier than similar species.
	I think Voldemort's arrogance has to be included in the equation.	Voldemort probably thought he was very clever, stumbling upon the Room of Requirement.
	Storm Front is probably the worst of the Dresden books.	Never read the Hollows, but can answer the parts about the Dresden universe.
	The best explanation comes from Picard in Star Trek: First Contact.	There was definitely a money system in the Star Trek Universe.
	I would start with the Chronicles and move on to the Legends series.	Mark Roger's answer of Chronicles, Legends, and Tales is a good answer.
	We know that the Puppeteer homeworld achieved 3% of the speed of light in 8 years, according to Juggler of Worlds.	How close to the Ringworld was the Fleet of Worlds?
	This comes from \"The Gripping Hand\", the sequel to \"The Mote in God's Eye\".	The way I understand the history, the concept of a “gripping hand” did originate in The Mote in God's Eye (published in 1974).
	The same way they got the van, the guns, and their clothes into the dream.	It's all part of the consciousness being shared by the dreamers.
	It's similar to the wind-up tech used in olden toys and watches.	I'd say the closest we have to that now would be a using a flywheel.
	Various bits of them can be used for magical purposes.	The blood is used to extend life or heal wounds.
	The most obvious answer is that the energy shield does not extend all the way to the ground.	I don't know what level of Canon the old Rogue Squadron games were, but I remember playing the Hoth level.
	I still think it could be River in the suit.	It has not been revealed in the story yet, so everything is speculation.
	I think it's a reference to Nathan's mother's boyfriend, Jeremy.	The black dog is a portent of death in many English folk tales.
	How would they be able to keep pace with the lesser, illogical races of the universe if they did?	Mathematics is a very logical langage and the Vulcans speak it all the time.
	I think that they do, at least they replicate the majority of the components and assemble them by hand.	With regards whole ship replication, there are notes in the Next Generation Technical Manual.
	No, Harry dropped the Stone before is encounter with Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest.	He was shot with Avada Kedavra, but he never died.
	I had always thought she was the daughter of a Daniel the 7th cylon.	I thought, too, that she was an Angel in keeping in line with the original series.
	I think the whole point is something like \"quality rather than quantity\".	I think the concept is that the insects trapped in amber are essentially unchanged as they are completely sealed off.
	Surely the facehugger would have the same kind of blood as the aliens themselves?	There's no reason why the first thing that the facehugger does has to be to extend the ovipositor.
	In Wishful Drinking http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1705977/ Carrie Fisher brings up her changing accent.	In Episode IV, Carrie Fisher pronounces Han Solo's first name as if he were the leader of the Han Dynasty.
	The unofficial reason is that JKR found it difficult to do something new in the Quidditch matches every book .	There was an official explanation, at the beginning of the year, that there was no Quidditch house cup.
	I have two reasons that work not only within the Star Wars universe, but our own as well: Visibility.	The directional thrusters wouldn't have to be in the rear of the ship but really that point doesn't matter.
1.80	I'd be more inclined to believe that it's some sort of ring world.	It is not hollow, it is round just as our world.
	I've not seen Origins, but this has been inconsistently displayed through the comics.	The Adamantium didn't replace his bones, they just covered them.
2.80	On the one hand, there’s nothing in canon to suggest that the Time Turners could go forwards in time.	Time Turners were explicitly mentioned for use in going back in time.
0.00	I was invited in to pitch story ideas to Ron Moore at ST:TNG.	It's obviously possible for it to leave the field without harm - it occurred.
	Their jurisdiction (prior to the new 52 that started this month) was the entire known universe*.	I read a fantastic short story that sounds similar and I've wanted to rediscover it for years.
0.60	First of all, let me say that there seems to be 3 main traits to casting a spell.	I always thought that Harry seemed to learn from the Half-Blood Prince better than he did from other sources.
	Well, first, I think it's because Harry is better than Hermione at Defence Against the Dark Arts in general.	The Patronus Charm, according to the Harry Potter series, is a powerful spell.
	I'd say yes, he was a Sith - just not a very good one.	Going by the Rule of Two, Vader can only become a Sith master if he strikes down the Emperor himself.
	Not an official reference as 2000AD online has not opened their wiki to the public.	I don't see how you can say it's an allegory based on just those points.
1.80	I started watching the Stargate series by watching Atlantis first!	Without delving into an in-depth analysis of Atlantis and Universe, I'll try and be as succinct as possible.
	I'm going to put several answers together, and add in a bit of own bit.	For the same reason every programmer in our world is not rich.
0.40	I voted for the dyson sphere as being the biggest realistic.	Allen Steele's book Hex describes a Dyson sphere, but made of hexagons, 1000 miles (K?
	So far there is no definitive answer in the books who the Prince That Was Promised is.	Melisandre herself admits that she makes mistakes reading the fires, interpreting the images she sees wrongly.
	There are several drive types in various games and shows that avoid dilation by not actually generating velocity.	At 80% of the speed of light, the time dilation is only 5:3 - one second on the ship is equal to 1.67 outside.
	To answer your second question, they were definitely not named because of that capability, even if the capability existed.	No, there is no mention of them being designed to cling on to a saucer section.
	As far as I have noticed, Elantris and Warbreaker are completely independent; there are no connections between their plots.	Quantum Teleportation and Molecular Replication The transporter and replicator technologies appear similar to the outside viewer.
	Real World Answer: The discrepancies are a series of continuity errors.	There's also the possibility that lower-priority messages are sent in a way more analagous to e-mail than a phone call.
	Answering your question of whether or not Voldemort knew Harry was a Horcrux: No, he did not.	Count of seven was 7 pieces of soul - this included his own chunk.
0.20	It was before the season began because Amy saw the woman before the Silence took her.	The exact timeline hasn't been listed yet, but there are a few assumptions we can make.
	Let's assume that the planet only orbits one of the stars.	In practice binary star systems can have the stars very widely spaced.
0.00	We have two parallel worlds in collision or maybe more.	Our intrepid heroes also didn't pursue the child who was in the spacesuit.
	We became the world described in it over the last 10 years.	Portions of this book hit really close to home in our present society.
	To add to what jwenting said, you can clearly see Vader hit by the emperor strikes.	I am pretty sure it was the 1952 Omnibus of Science Fiction.
	What do you mean by \"reincarnation as opposed to a ghola\"?	Humans in the Grid seem to age at the same rate they do outside the Grid.
	This is an Alderson Disk and has been featured in Godwheel.	It could be Pratchett, he has written stories other than those in Discworld; one of them is Strata.
	That logic is like assuming because of the HP Pavillion DV6000, there must have been 5999 previous models.	There were actually several ships of the Constitution class with numbers lower than 1700 and which were built after the Constitution.
	Storm Front is probably the worst of the Dresden books.	I agree with @apoorv020's post, but think it could be expanded upon.
	Yep, the book pretty clearly states that the boat was designed for two - 1 Wizard and one not.	No, I don't think there is any good reason why not.
	TL;DR (for my answer, not the question): Depends on the author.	According to the World War Z novel, the zombie digestive tract doesn't work.
	There's a mythical creature called a Namazu - a giant catfish.	Hayao Miyazaki is known for his fairy tale styled movies.
	Mark Roger's answer of Chronicles, Legends, and Tales is a good answer.	I once did some research on this and compiled two reading order lists.
	Surely the facehugger would have the same kind of blood as the aliens themselves?	While the other answer is quite well thought out, there's another possibility I've been thinking about for years.
	In Anne Rice novels vampires wake up each night with the hair they had when they became vampires.	I dont know if it's a cannon answer, but A Chemical depilatory like Nair would do the job.
	I suspect it was deliberately kept vague to make a good story.	I don't recall very clearly, but I think this issue was raised in the first movie.
	After taking a random guess, I figured I'd do some more research and find out more details.	It's hard to tell exactly how much time has passed from the outbreak to the start of the show.
	Aside from factual details in DavRob's answer, they are different applications.	Snow Crash was published in 1992, but it was written well before that.
	First, it is explicitly stated that electronics don't work in areas with a lot of magic around.	In order for Muggles to use weapons, a number of things would have to happen.
	I think that the British cultural aversion to guns would apply in this case.	In order for Muggles to use weapons, a number of things would have to happen.
	While all of these are very good suggestions and they have some sort of evidence as backup.	Those are a kind of symbiotic protozoa or bacteria, aren't they?
1.40	Dick was an idea guy and a people guy, not a science guy.	Most of Philip K Dick's works aren't hard Sci-Fi in the least.
	From a purely technical standpoint, it was clearly a design flaw in that it went STRAIGHT DOWN.	The Empire doesn't regard a one-man fighter as a threat, or they'd have a tighter defense!
0.00	First, we must consider that \"Sphere\" is less Hard SF and more soft SF, thriller, airport novel and such.	\"Fins\" on real spacecraft are usually for one of two purposes: solar panels or thermal radiators.
0.60	According to canon, Leia was an expert in combat, especially shooting (this is from EU books).	In real-world combat, most fire is used to suppress the enemy, not kill them.
	I’m going to make some suggestions that might help us make more sense of, Why the Cup?!	I have seen all of these other than Confessions d'un Barjo as it is French and really hard to find.
	Anthony Burgess' \"A Clockwork Orange\" was written in 1962, and contained an entire lexicon of \"Nadsat\" slang.	Star Wars (at least the extended universe) has a fairly robust set of profanity.
	I also read up on some stuff while playing the game and afterwards...	Whatever you do, start with Eisenhorn (or maybe even Inquisition War) or Gaunts Ghosts, or something else.
0.80	I don't think we have a solid theory of mammal speciation.	The short answer is that evolution couldn't create gills in humans.
	He was so old and the conditions where he lived last 40 years were bad.	The unbalance in the force caused him to become agile and sick.
	One possibility is that his wife was right - he's still in a dreamworld.	\"If he could manage to stay hidden alone, he could stay hidden with his kids as well\" doesn't hold water.
	Perhaps \"in the future\" means after time machines have been invented in their natural time stream.	To be a bit graphic, the human stomach only holds so much meat.
0.20	Here is the 2006 cover release, choice B in your question is the 2006 version.	Wikipedia's compilation of Time Travel Rules is a good resource to check about this subject.
	\"Mayflies\" by Kevin O'Donnell tells the story of a generation ship, built as an escape from a dying Earth.	I'd add The Book of the Long Sun tetralogy by Gene Wolf.
	I know they have to be careful with idiom at first in Stranger in a Strange Land.	It's a Philip K. Dick short story called The Eyes Have It.
	From my understanding a big part of how long the gate stays open is based on power consumption.	One theory is: Caesar was born with genetic variations with more human like genes resulting in more human-like vocal cords.
	This is a very often-debated subject… You'll want to tailor the choice to that person's taste.	For a younger reader---especially but not exclusively a young lady---consider Wee Free Men, the first of the Tiffany Achings novels.
	Star Wars has its own magnificent historical timeline in addition to being a masterfully executed space-based science fantasy.	The quality of the science is not really the question here.
	\"Counterfeit Worlds: Philip K. Dick on Film\" by Brian J. Robb has a fairly lengthy article in it about Total Recall.	Actually, Total Recall was based on book by Philip K. Dick called \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\".
	The black dog is a portent of death in many English folk tales.	I believe Starship Troopers had FTL, but I am unclear as to how it works.
	This type of warp drive is known as an Alcubierre drive, proposed by the Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre.	The matter-antimatter reaction is just the energy source for the work it has to do.
	The WoT Wiki says that publication was pushed back from late 2011 to March 2012.	Brandon's latest post about this said it will not be out before Summer 2012, and should definitely be out by November.
	Martinho lists everything I considered, but the one thing I think he missed was Ringworld Hindmost's engineering skill.	The Hindmosts, I recall, were Nike, then Baedeker, then Achilles (based on the XXX of Worlds series).
	The Doctor says in A Good Man Goes to War that it must've happened 'before America'.	It was before the season began because Amy saw the woman before the Silence took her.
	Note: We had a very similar question on Writers.SE; I'm cross-posting my answer from there, adjusted to your specific question.	Fantasy stories need to go into details that real-world-based fiction doesn't: cultures, politics, religions, biology, magic, science, technology, you name it.
2.20	Sign language maybe, since there is no tone to convey meaning, emotion or intent.	It is safe to say that body posture plays a big role in all languages.
1.80	Remember, from the Fleet's point of view, the rest of the galaxy is what's moving and experiencing time dilation.	Well, it really depends on how long he was there, and the exact speed of the Fleet.
	I've always attributed this to the size of the debris that collided with the ship.	I think the shield technology is a little different than the later ellipsoid ones.
	It was learned with 2001: A Space Odyssey, released in 1968, that 100% pure space realism doesn't make for good sound design.	I was under the impression that, on some scenes, it was done properly.
	Yes, here is a quote from Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace script.	The novel I, Jedi touches on lightsabers, their construction, and their power.
	There is one difference between this question and the invisible man question.	If you look closely either with eyes or sensors you can observe a disruption where the ship is.
	The alien was, iirc, huddled on its side in a small alcove.	I guess you are talking about the first movie, Alien.
	In addition to the already given reasons, there are some additional very good reason for this.	I can think of one notable reboot in print fiction.
0.20	This idea has been around since the beginning of myth and storytelling.	The science behind superheroes might shed some light on this topic.
	I suspect it was deliberately kept vague to make a good story.	Update - this has been bugging me for a while, I finally had to write it out.
	Lightsabers have changed little in the thousands of years of their employ by the Jedi Knights.	There is no good physical hypothetical model of a lightsaber.
	At one point there was English but it has been phased out in subsequent versions of the films.	In the original New Hope when Luke scans the desert with his binoculars the numbers are Arabic numbers.
4.00	Is it possible for a match to get tie even after applying D/L method?	Yes, it's possible for a match to get tie after applying the D/L method.
4.20	Yes a team can use the same player for both bowling and batting in a super over.	There's no rule that decides which players can be picked for bowling/batting in the Super Over.
4.40	It is simply the number of balls bowled divided by the number of wickets taken.	Bowling strike rate is defined for a bowler as the average number of balls bowled per wicket taken.
	As per BCCI.TV Brendon McCullum was declared man of the series.	They have not awarded a man of the series award.
	I haven't seen a pro team use a sweeper in YEARS.	Even in the modern era you could find teams playing with a sweeper.

	The rule is in place so that a manager can't keep coming out and slowing down the game.	This was at least in place when I was a child and first watching baseball games in the mid 1980's.
	You'll need to incorporate weight training and/or intervals in order to maintain (or increase) your muscle mass.	You need to sprint rather than run for endurance if you're trying to build muscle mass.
	Albanian Ledio Pano has perfect record scoring over 50 penalties for various teams in Greece and Albania.	Rickie Lambert converted all of his 32 penalties for Southampton FC.
	Of course it's legal and has happened many times other than the accepted answer's example.	Yes, it is legal - and as someone already claimed, even required if all other players have taken theirs.
	The meaning of the dead ball is no further actions can be performed after the ball is declared as dead.	I don't think you can get run out after the umpire signals over.
	This has occurred in the match between Australia and South Africa.	Yes, it's possible to share the Man of the Match award between two players of the same team.
	Running downhill is more physically demanding, as your body is doing more to resist the force of gravity.	Mile for mile, running uphill requires a greater amount of physical work to be performed.
2.60	We only used Fartlek as a fitness measurement, and as a bit of fun.	Fartlek is not more effective than any proper interval training - just more fun!
0.60	If the number of fours hit by two teams are also equal then both teams will get 1 point each.	This is the rule if the runs scored by two teams in Super Over is equal...
	The \"neighborhood play\" at second base, where the fielder doesn't actually touch second base during a double play attempt.	We used to call \"The neighborhood play\" \"The Phatom double\".
	There are two types of left arm spin bowlers, Chinaman and Orthodox.	A right handed off spinner bowls exactly the same ball as a chinaman (i.e.
	In the said case, the batting side wins by 1 wicket.	Wide ball will earn 1 run for batting side and they will win.
	No matter what, runners are never out until they are tagged in this situation.	Technically the play cannot end with two runners on the same base.
3.20	Women first appeared in the modern Olympics in Croquet at the 1900 Olympics.	In 1900, the second modern Olympic games, 22 women competed in 5 events: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian, and golf.
	Searching the internet for a possible answers, made me realize that this question has been asked many times before.	The answer is no, the Triple Lindy has never been (successfully) performed in real life.

	The stated rational behind the introduction of the play-off in the Turkish league was last year's corruption scandal.	Sometimes the best team is not reflected in the win/loss ratio.
	To answer the question on places to read about football strategy, I would highly recommend Zonal Marking.	There have been quite a few studies in football/soccer discussing home field advantage.
	I've searched the internet and found some really good \"How To's\".	have had a breakthrough with this trick and have landed a fair few.
	You are misinterpreting the rule; you can pass the ball to your goalie using your head, chest or whatever.	In 1992, FIFA introduced the Back-Pass rule in an attempt to speed up the game and reduce time wasting.
	Unlike in cricket, its really hard to stop the game in between a football game.	There is NO good reason for the failure to implement video plays in professional soccer.
	There are quite a few actually; practically every game between Turkey and Germany have had some player \"upsetting\" one side.	In the game between Albania and Switzerland in 2011, X. Shaqiri scored the opening goal.
	The top of the ball will be going in the same direction of the wind.	More likely what happened is that the shot had little to no spin on it at all.
2.60	It is hard to speak for a team, know what their strategy is going into a draft.	Drafting has changed dramatically with the new collective bargaining agreement.
	The Ranji Trophy is India's domestic cricket competition played between teams representing REGIONAL cricket associations.	There is an another cricket team named Vidarbha cricket team which is also from the state of Maharashtra.
1.20	To play golf, the first thing you need is a set of clubs.	Having fairly recently taken up the sport myself, I feel your discomfort.
3.00	Yes, dew (wetness in the environment) factor can change the direction of a match.	Another disadvantage of the dew factor is that it makes hitting boundaries difficult.
	Boxing has a win in 10 seconds via knockout, or instantly if the referee calls it.	I have found record of one sport that had an instant win move.
	Here's an attempt to layout the history of the position, and the time periods in which it changed.	It all goes back to the beginning of the game.
	You would think they wouldn't include a blatant violation, but they did.	Lebron haters need to forget about your biased hatred for a minute here.
	Having done 37 marathons I can say some are definitely nicer than others.	As most probably you're doing this for fun, then choose the marathons that you like.
	Domestically, you start at the club level and work your way through the ranks.	As an umpire for cricket you are responsible for the calling of many intricate rules of the game.
0.00	Reading your post, made me think of my younger years !!	I'd say you need to distract yourself from the bigger picture.
	Table tennis is to \"real\" tennis as \"miniature\" golf (putt-putt) is to \"real golf.	My answer to this question (from years of observing the effects of playing both sports) is both yes and no.
2.60	There is NO good reason for the failure to implement video plays in professional soccer.	There is another problem with applying instant replays beyond just interrupting the flow of the game.
	Putting a ball in it and tying it up will help create a pocket.	Tying up the glove by itself, even with a ball inside doesn't really aid in breaking it in.
	1934 was the year that the Portsmouth Spartans moved to Detroit and became the Detroit Lions.	I highly doubt it is referring to a score of a game for one reason.
	If its a new disc you may want to try bending it down towards the concave side.	This YouTube video does an excellent job covering all aspects of overhand throws.
1.20	Basically, the rule is that you must play the ball, and not the man, until someone catches the ball.	It is fairly simple to understand, somewhat harder to referee.
	It all really depends on what kind of running you are doing.	I have run 8 marathons and the first 4 I did using traditional programs that involved 5 or 6 days a week of running.
	Don't stress about being the best or worst player on the course.	Learn a golf swing that is based on sound science and mechanics.
	The replacement refs have, actually, made some atrocious calls throughout this preseason.	There are several anecdotal issues we've observed thus far, most notably the 4th timeout given to the Seattle Seahawks.
	Any number of new metrics can be introduced to predict the winning percentages.	Goal.com had a table on how much refs get paid in the top leagues in Europe from around 2011.
	This was handled the same way small local swim meets are handled these days: stopwatches.	When I used to swim there was also a place judge and ties were decided by him.
	A center needs to have the firmest hands because he is the one \"hiking\" the ball to the quarterback.	Tackles, and in particular left tackles, tend to be the elite positions on the offensive line.
	I'm in a similar situation, albeit I only run half-marathons and bike up to 60km.	A good bet is that this is probably caused by being nervous, and you might be hyperventilating.
	This might sound very unhelpful, but really the only solution is lots of practice.	The majority of the time it is a better plan to draw the penalty then immediately get the 5 on three.
	I think it was the 4-4-2. it had slighter modification like 4-1-2-1-2 and 4-2-2-2.	It is certainly 4-4-2 as almost all teams in England were using that formation back then.
	The seedings are based on the rankings of the each of the participating nation at the cut off point.	Ten of the teams in the ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup are \"seeded\" teams.
	Basically it is used for a delivery which is too good, almost unplayable and completely beats the batsman.	For right-arm bowlers, off spinners spin from off to leg and leg spinners spin from leg to off.
	I am an assistant fencing coach for a collegiate club.	Fencing is really very safe as long as you go to a real club and follow directions.
	All my experience is in warm sub-tropics so NO WETSUIt swims.	I would suspect the primary benefit is time saved in transition.
	Will Cole's point #3 is the closest to an accurate answer.	There are an awful lot of contributing reasons that the wishbone is not used more often.
	There are two variants of the fingers over the eye salute.	This is done to show that they are a \"Dead Eye\" shooter from 3 point range.
2.80	At the highest level, a pace setter helps ensure they meet their game plan for the race exactly.	From personal experience I found that a pace setter to be incredibly helpful.
0.20	I can think of three key factors that are quite logical conjectures.	There have been quite a few studies in football/soccer discussing home field advantage.
	First of all, I'm writing this on my phone, so I wont bring you any sources at the moment.	If a player is sent off by an direct red card, he misses the next tow or more matches.
	Trailrunnerx on osx can sync with nike+, including after Nike's recent changes to their API.	http://www.rungap.com/ supports a whole bunch of apps including Runkeeper, Garmin and Nike+.
	I haven't found any technical tool under \"indepedent training management\" rather mechanical innovations.	Have you tried using a professionally made orthotic (not the one you buy in the store)?
	Willie O'Ree is the considered the first African American to play professionally in the NHL.	As Tom Au stated, from a backer's perspective, the ”strong side” can simply be considered the side with the most receivers.
	Grass fields can get torn up easily especially if the ground is wet.	Artificial turf is now a permanent feature in the hockey world.
	To play golf, the first thing you need is a set of clubs.	Don't stress about being the best or worst player on the course.
	The \"neighborhood play\" at second base, where the fielder doesn't actually touch second base during a double play attempt.	To add to Hennish's list, don't bunt when you have a large lead.
	Wet suits will make you more buoyant which for a swimmer is not a good thing.	Differing suits might provide a benefit, but I think that would be offset by your overall skill level.
	So far this delivery has been used for well over a hundred years.	Doosra and teesra, both these bowling techniques were invented to deceive the batsman.
	I can't find anything in the rules to back this up, but I believe the call was correct.	This basic play was very confusing in our game yesterday: Bases loaded one out.
1.80	The movement of the ball in the air is called swing bowling.	Both of these styles of bowling are performed by bowlers who are medium pace or fast bowlers.
0.00	Actually, it's much more easier to count the one NOT on the same continent.	That is also the recommended strategy for marathons, if you are going for time.
0.00	Red ball under yellow floodlight takes on a brownish color which is very similar to the color of the pitch.	I am too a hobby swimmer but as part of my triathlon training.
	You definitely can do it, and it is fine where you have clean, dry climbing surfaces.	its way easier in the gym to go bare foot.
	Generally you want signs to be simple between a pitcher and a catcher.	The pitcher has the final decision, since he is the one throwing the pitch.
	Essentially it hasn't been introduced by UEFA because the top brass don't support it because of the financial cost.	As I understand it; the costs of technology isn't the big issue.
	Yes, it makes a difference whether it's the serve or in general play.	According the official LAWS OF BADMINTON, set by the Badminton World Federation, chapter 14 is affected: LETS.
	No, penalty runs will not be given if the ball hits the helmet of the wicket-keeper when wearing it.	It depends what you mean by \"losing control\" and by \"ideal sailing boat\".
3.00	No, there is no specific criteria for giving the man of the match award.	As per the rules, MoM award is decide by the commentry pannel.
	If your question is if this system is fair, then my response is that it is highly criticized.	D/L or any other method is necessarily an approximation, so there will always be some strange edge cases.
0.00	I can't think of the specifics, but I seem to remember this scenario from many years ago.	The Laws of Cricket say that you can declare any innings, no matter what the agreed length is.
	To answer the question on places to read about football strategy, I would highly recommend Zonal Marking.	Well for one, you have the advantage of not being over run in midfield.
2.40	As per FIFA's \"Equipment Regulations\", Section 22, only the goalkeeper is permitted to wear a cap.	Although headgear is allowed to be worn, it is not advised for anyone other than the goalkeeper.
	The first level of the pagoda: The primary key to jumping is balance.	From what I recall the most penalties in one international game I saw was 5 penalties on the 4th of July, 1999.
	The front row players can half-stretch their arms during the serve, without moving them.	The official rules (as you cite in your question) prohibit screening.
0.40	Glad to hear you've started playing hockey, its a great sport!	A general rule of thumb is every 5-6 hours of skating.
	As far as I am concerned substitutes are used late on for one thing i.e.	One additional reason would be to avoid a second yellow card turning to red and then a ban.
	They are similar and different because they share a similar lineage.	The shape of both is mostly to do with aerodynamics.
	A good bet is that this is probably caused by being nervous, and you might be hyperventilating.	This might seem a stupid question, but are you breathing out when your head is underwater?
2.60	I prefer to run the second half 1-2 minutes faster then the first.	I would definitely go for a slightly slower first half.
	What do players that are available but are not playing, because you have enough, do?	I'm not familiar enough with Cricket to offer a specific, concrete solution.
	This tactic generally really only applies to teams with offenses that are directed by a good/excellent Quarterback.	In that particular situation, the Patriots were allowing the Giants to score because of 2 important reasons.
	Apart from batting out of order, the answer is no.	There is no appeal, and a pitch is made to Abel.
	There's a reason that Sports Psychology has grown into a pretty large niche of psychology overall.	“PRACTICING THE CORRECT ONES MAKES PERFECT.” My 100 shots in a row last July 27, 2014.
	The above answer is a good one but it only addresses fuel efficiency.	2014 introduced a new rule that fundamentally changes much of the strategy behind a Formula 1 race.
0.00	It was random that she faced Li Na in the first round - not because she's seeded/ranked #127.	This was too long for a comment, so I am posting it as a CW-answer.
	The bowler may be presented with the ball at the end of the innings, as a trophy for his achievement.	A hattrick is just a fancy informal term to describe 3 wickets taken in 3 consecutive deliveries by a bowler.
	Colorado native chiming in: There's all manner of ski resorts within easy reach of Europe in Colorado.	There are literally hundreds of ski resorts in North America.
3.60	For the most part you can apply at any US consulate.	Generally you're supposed to apply at the US consulate at your place of residence.
	And yes they do charge more for these types of rentals.	Any of the major car rental companies will allow a \"One-way\" rentals.
1.80	There is one airline, Spirit Airlines, which is trying to copy Ryanair with super cheap tickets and aggressively bad service.	There are a few airlines which operate flights at lower fares.
	It depends not on which country is your home but which country offers the best exchange rates.	This varies very much depending on your country of origin and your destination.
	In Poland camping in the wild is tolerated, especially in the mountains.	Wild camping is not allowed in Germany; you have to go to a campsite.
	Chicago CTA for within the city limits - http://www.transitchicago.com/ - Trains are pretty decent in the city.	Certainly there are cargo ships with berths available in the Caribbean: http://www.cargoshipvoyages.com/ViewAllVoyages/?regiontoshow=2 As an example.
1.60	I'd suggest you find a bank in your local country, and consider opening a Euro denominated bank account with them.	I am not sure if you can open a bank account in France if you are not a resident.
	I wouldn't stress about these emails, or the advanced notification at all.	I think you're referring to APIS - Advance Passenger Information System.
	I have also been in Cuba more than 5 years ago and I have never carried my passport.	I actually asked this question a few months ago to a representative of a Cuban consulate.
	Also it is more likely to get a jet bridge when traveling with the local airline.	Some airport only use buses for specific types of flights, often involving smaller planes.
2.00	As I remember, in Geneva at least, there are open air markets on a weekly basis.	This page list all the big Christmas markets in Switzerland.
	Of the bigger countries, New Zealand is the first to celebrate New Year.	You can see this in the Wikipedia list or on any map with the International Date Line.
	I'm almost always check the websites of the ministries of foreign affairs of my neighboring countries.	If you want the American point of view of each country then the State Department is the place to go.
	One way would be to go through an Adventure travel company that offers trips in the region.	I recommend you to go with a local guide instead of an international one.
	You can actually find a list of Adult Only resorts on this page.	I spent the month of August in a little town in northern Portugal on the coast - Praia de Mira.
	The first that comes to mind are the amazing ciders made in Sweden.	The gift that to me would be most expressive of Sweden is the delahast, the little horse figurine.
	If you're only worried about them stealing the car and not the contents I would remove the distributor cap.	Some great answers here, but sometimes the best deterrent is a little bit of clever social engineering.
2.00	My experience is that a normal taxi is always cheaper.	When using a regular taxi make sure it's with a reputable company or you agree upon the rate upfront.
	Istanbul is far enough to the south to have decent daylight in January.	Well since you ruled out my favourite winter city in Europe (Paris) I will have to recommend another.
	I got a Berlittz pocket sized French & Spanish books for when I was recently in France & Spain.	I think it's relatively easy to find en English-speaker in France or in Spain.
	The license held restriction is normally required by the insurance companies the rental places use.	The reason you see resemblance is because its an \"old\" airport.
	The answer is that it can be done, and without too much stress!	I landed in terminal 3 and flew out of terminal 1 last year.
	In order to avoid the tourist traps, someone in your party needs to speak the language.	For Travelling to Nepal, This will provides you in detail about Money exchanging.

0.00	I had a similar issue but in what seemed to be a simpler situation.	I'm actually about to do the same thing when transferring at London Heathrow.
	If you own an iPad something like MindNode or iMindMap might be worth looking at.	You may want to consider some kind of online note-taking software, like Evernote.
	Further to earlier answers, the information given so far is bit vague and so might mislead.	The nearest Cambodian town is Stung Treng, and the border is a 90-minute speedboat or bus ride away.
2.60	A technical stop is for the benefit of the PLANE.	Usually it's a refuelling stop, and you just sit on the plane.
	The hotspot you link to is a 3G to wifi device.	Whether or not you get a Japanese number, calling Japanese numbers from skype was totally fine, and super-cheap.
	Non-airconditioned classes tend to have less strict ticket checks starting with the lowest class and gradually increasing till the highest class.	Second AC (2AC class), I won't recommend above and below this class.
	You mention 120 GB of data, and \"long holidays\" so I'll assume that's for something on the order of two months.	My friends used a similar system to Mark's while travelling around Africa.
	It's very hard to make a universal socket that's compliant with all the safety standards that would apply.	In India, a lot of plug sockets look like this they seem to accept plug types from most countries.
	We stayed in a kibbutz at Ein Gedi which was nice.	If you are planning on visiting/climbing Masada, it is in a convenient location close to the Dead Sea.
	In most cultures where toilet paper is NOT used, people still need to clean up, right?	Well firstly, some find the whole 'toilet' discussion mildly gross, rude or offensive - even if some don't think so.
0.40	Kyoto, at least does, as described here: JR Kyoto Station.	Coin lockers are a feature of most stations in Japan.
	For me it works quite well to try to estimate a daily budget for a given country/region.	This has been reduced to an art form by Paul TerHorst and his wife Vicki.
0.00	There's a geek answer to this, and a practical answer to this.	It's pretty ridiculous that I've seen airlines ask for these to be turned off at times.
	Well personally, I find a yawn is by far the easiest and least painful way of inducing the so-called 'pop'.	I have had ear difficulties since I was a baby, and was inflicted with many earaches as a youngster.
	(That assumes that your local airport in the states is big enough to have middle eastern airlines serve it!).	As shown at Great Circle Mapper, Toronto to Sydney is 44% longer via London and Singapore versus via Vancouver.
	The answer you get will depend entirely on who you ask...	Quite some time ago I have been on a couple of such trips.
	The only website that I know is Farecast, that now seems to be called Bing Travel.	Expedia and lastminute flight searches will show you flights with stops.

	I was in a situation where I had to mail in my passport for a visa - no problems for me.	Travellers from many countries don't face this experience due to visa-free / visa-on-arrival arrangements.
	You're a little off, but if you Google for ETOPS you'll find the details on what you're referring to.	Credit Cards are a fairly safe method, when they are accepted.
	Check with your bank to be sure, but I would say Yes.	I found it hard enough finding an ATM in Vancouver that would even ACCEPT my card (or my friend's).
	The Pilar Festival is held every year around the second week of October in Zaragoza.	Cabo de Gata in Almeria is a good place to get in touch with nature.

	You might be able to get a second passport from your Government.	I just came back from a visit to Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh.
	True to the name, the LCCT terminal is pretty barebones and has little of interest.	This page collects lots of information about the total solar eclipse of 2012.
1.80	Generally, almost wherever I go, I find it's easiest to get money out of the ATM.	There are plenty of ATMs and Exchanges all around the city, especially in city center.
	For questions like this, I prefer the scientific and mathematical approach.	This map shows the tropical rain forest in the whole world.
	You don't need US driver's license, just your national one.	If your license is in a language other than English then you should get an IDP BEFORE entering the US.
	I've only been to a couple of different places, but Hobbiton was pretty cool and I'd definitely recommend it.	On Trip Advisor I think the highest rated in is Twizel, largest location in NZ and is Gondor.
	Work visas aren't going to be given on arrival anywhere (I'd be highly surprised if they did).	I've obtained several distinct work visas in Germany, all were post arrival visas.
	Answers to 1b: Depending where you go, you can use FON.	In Europe you still need a separate SIM for every country (unfortunately).
	Australia has fruit picking, which is commonly done by seasonal labour (a.k.a packpackers).	In at least western Canada the thing to do is tree planting.
1.60	The most obvious is the oldest long distance walk in Scotland: The West Highland Way.	Look at this: http://www.capewrathtrail.co.uk/ You could do it in stages.
	As was mentioned already the major two carriers in Australia are Vodafone and Telstra.	2 years ago, I got a Vodafone SIM card with a prepaid 1GB / 1 month plan and a SIM-locked 3G USB stick for 100 AUD.
	As @Doc said, X-ray do not damage electronic devices, however, metal detectors may.	Millions of smartphones and 10's (if not 100's) of thousands of Kindles/E-book readers go through airport scanners every day.
1.00	The answer will depend significantly on what country you're traveling to.	As someone who has always travelled with a lot of prescription medication, I always declare it.
	German event organizer Jochen Schweizer offers flying a MiG 29 in Nizhniy Novgorod for 14.5k EUR.	adrenalin.com.au  has some offers for Australia, and you have the choice between a L-39 fighter jet and a A37B ex-military jet.

	I've just been in Rovaniemi, Finland a couple of weeks ago.	My friends, boyfriend and I are talking about going to Yellowknife, Canada.
	I don't think Åre or Funäsfjällen are really so far away as to be impossible.	There are 3 main alternatives that are as close to Stockholm as Romme.
	A city that is very near to Helsinki (maybe 1 hour by direct bus connection) is Porvoo.	Are there any current major Finnish cities where the architecture is medieval, or at least \"pre modern\" (before the late 1600s)?
	I'm not certain this should be down to country or culture.	Always ask before taking a photo - unless they won't know if you take it.
	I'll just mention that you are not likely to experience any problems in crossing the US/Canada border by car.	The car rental cost only for the compact was quoted as $789.

	Before we discuss ways to get in, you first need to remember that lounges aren't free.	Depending on the airline, quite often members of Priority Clubs can invite a guest into the lounge with them.
	I've been living in the LA area (in Long Beach, exactly) for 7 months, being there for studying abroad.	I have been to LA several times and have used different kinds of transportation: car, public transport, bicycle and walking.
	http://www.php.net/ Down the right hand side there are many user group.	I've just been to a meetup group on Saturday with Sapporo.rb.
	Having done London to Singapore by train¹ I know a little bit about long train rides.	Food Make sure to buy some food before you go.
	Another possibility is the FunTouristAttractions map of Europe - but again, not many natural attractions on it.	UNESCO World Heritage Center provides a list with a map.
	A backpacker friend of mine managed to get hired as crew member on a sail boat.	Naturally it depends how strict a budget you're on as a backpacker, or flashpacker or however you define yourself.
	The final solution was two-fold: I ended up staying a few nights in Burnaby.	There's a fairly new YHA/HI on Granville which is one of the main drags right downtown.
	One additional factor to consider is if your suitcases have sufficient structural rigidity to survive the trip empty.	I work in other country and annually travel to my home country.
	My method is to keep valuables in a piece of luggage that locks.	In general, don't be paranoid as it spoils the fun!
	I'd suggest you give some consideration to visiting the Loire Valley.	Roflcopter already covered a lot, I can add: Giverny which has Claude Monet's house and gardens.
	Nothing, really, unless you mean to stay in the jungles for a while.	According to the CDC, they recommend MMR, DPT, polio, Hep A/B, Typhoid and Japanese encephalitis Also Malaria meds are recommended.
	Most places will accept a photocopy along with a security deposit - same with cars.	The answers above are not only generic, but inaccurate for Thailand.
	Zurich is very nicely, centrally located, in Switzerland, both within the country itself, and in relation to neighboring countries.	If you like science I'd recommend the Technorama (Swiss Science Center).
	I have recently done a lot of research in to guides for doing Mt.	I climbed Kilimanjaro a couple of weeks ago, and booked it with Gap Adventures.
	This trip, I stayed in Sapporo, Zao Onsen, Sendai, and a few nights in Tokyo.	Wasn't aware of any discrimination what so ever when I traveled in Japan.
	Megabus is hands down the cheapest buy for the value, granted you're on the Eastern side of the plains.	I think you're limited to renting a car or traveling on Greyhound.
0.60	There are trains via Knin, which means a large detour inland (there just isn't a coastal line).	As others have said if you want to get to Split the best public transport offering is by bus.
	Plastic wrap, or some sort of net, is also a common technique for people traveling with backpacking packs.	For safety reasons, to protect your bag from scratches and liquid that could come out of other bags.
	Travel Books is the traditional option: Lonely Planet, Fodors, Rick Steves, Rough Guide, etc.	One site that lets you explore places through photography is http://fotons.com/.
	Burning Man Festival itself organises a ticket exchange programme for those interested in reselling their tickets.	It should go without saying that buying in the open market is a bad idea, but don't forget Craigslist.
	In Israel hitchhiking (Tremping) is pretty common, though I would not recommend it for tourists.	In France, there are no such road signs, but there are ways to organize hitchhiking.
1.00	Would going on a cargo ship count as a tour?	Ozbus offer a 29 week tour of South America, starting and finishing in Quito.
	There are many but, and I think this list may not be all, but certainly most.	Actually, Hostelbookers has a page dedicated just to the Top 15 Quirky and Unusual Hotels Across the Globe.
	As I remember, in Geneva at least, there are open air markets on a weekly basis.	The most simple answer to this is \"because they can\"!
	100% DEET is certainly very effective, but it's hard on your skin.	I live in a tropical country with a lot of mosquitoes in some beaches I regularly visit.
	This ploy is known as \"hidden-city ticketing\", and you should find plenty written about it if you search for that term.	I don't think Åre or Funäsfjällen are really so far away as to be impossible.
	For France, a great site for renting farmhouses in coutryside or small villages is Gîtes de France.	Just an addition to Mark Mayo's answer, Roomorama is also a website that similar to AirBnb.
	My assumption is that TSA is concerned about what could be concealed within the liquid.	When you're making rules like this, simplicity and objectivity are vital.
	Personally I have a OV-chipkaart which is connected to my train reduction card.	Would getting a nominative card enable me to recharge it through the website without a Dutch banking card?
	Yes, have all the documentation of your travel prepared for each leg!	I know someone who tried to do this with a one-way ticket from Europe to the USA.
2.80	English works everywhere with people buying and selling things and in the hospitality and tourism busniness.	I traveled around Maharashtra (including Mumbai) and Andhra Pradesh and I had no problem getting by with just English.
2.60	I think the dual goals have a lot to do with the purpose of the antagonist.	I think it's going to depend on what the reasons are.
3.40	There is nothing wrong with the phrase \"simple sample service\".	The minimal change needed to avoid disconcerting alliteration is to just call it a \"simple example service\".
1.60	I've started my own tool since I didn't like yWriter and Storybook.	I've tried many of the things mentioned above, but they never really worked for me.
4.00	Yes, this is OK, as it allows you to emphasise certain things, that you want the readers to notice.	I believe this is perfectly acceptable and does a good job of emphasising your point.
	Some writers will tell you that writing fan fiction is lazy, uncreative, a fruitless endeavor, and a waste of time.	Generally, the acceptability of fan fiction depends on the original story.
	First person has the unfortunate side-effect of being narrated in an extreme sort of way.	With a story in first person, you are intending the reader to become much more attached to the main character.
	If your plot is no longer interesting to you, let it go.	Distinguish between losing interest in the project and merely losing interest in its current state.
	It's (almost) grammatically correct, but it doesn't seem \"natural\" to me at all.	Yes, it feels like natural English to me (native English speaker).
1.80	For fiction, I have little proof to show of blogs being published as print and/or ebooks.	To answer your question, yes, I think blogging your fiction will hurt your attempts to be traditionally published later.
	There are many good copywriting software packages, books, and even courses available.	While you are checking out courses and deciding, start a swipe file.
	I'm inclined to say no, in that any answer will depend entirely on the genre that you're writing in.	What has worked for me in the past is to simply concentrate on telling the story.
	Your writing career will only end if you stop writing.	Like others have said, if writing is truly something you want to do, you can find time to do it.
	I think this is completely a matter of personal preference.	I try to write primarily at the computer, for the sake of revision control.
	What is your purpose in writing about a foreign country or place?	The first step is to hold back your urge to write.
	\"In the\" sounds like it's going on for a while — a chapter or two.	I think of things happening in sections of books, not at (which implies a location) sections of books.
	You might not get the publicity you're looking for from these kinds of sites.	Goodreads.com does that -- even better, you can get attention from as many individuals as you give out copies.
0.20	David Weber's The War God's Own has some lengthy travel scenes in it which he does quite well.	One thing that should be used as a seasoning in Odyssey tales is the idea of the false destination.
0.00	You have to define the problem before attempting a solution.	Whenever I start reading the same lines over and over again, I start skimming.
	I wrote a novel a couple years ago and I have two pieces of advice for the beginning steps.	There are myriad questions on this site that already address this issue, and the consensus is always the same.
	In its broadest sense, I would define purple prose as excessive and imprecise description.	\"Purple prose\" is overwrought metaphors, melodramatic and clichéd phrasing, and cartoonish actions.
	You just need to shut off the inner critic, and start writing.	I guess it depends on how the blank page is overwhelming you.
	If you want a Windows option, HP and Dell both have great tablets.	I own a 64 GB Transformer Prime and I love it!
1.40	Your worry is a valid one; the reader could be frustrated by this.	I don't believe not knowing a character's name would be confusing unless you make it so.
	I write in a similar vein, and sometimes face the same problem.	\"the world is quite rich with events\"-->Are these events related to one another?
	I personally love spiral notebooks when I'm out and about.	As FoxCutter has said elsewhere, for many of us Moleskine is hard to beat.
	You have two items to consider: what makes a person likable, and why you would sympathize with someone.	There's a number of movies that feature criminals that are either the protagonist or a likeable character in some way.
	Under US law, a direct parody is considered \"fair use\".	One of the difficulties you face is that of passing off.
0.00	No, you don't need to have taken classes or earned a degree in your area.	I have done quite a bit of technical writing for healthcare information systems.
1.20	One thing you seem to be forgetting regarding myths, is they are extremely prevalent stories.	I noticed you said \"movie critics\" enjoy mythological references in a film, but do audiences?
	I believe it depends on whether you are trying to be personable or professional.	Using third person offers the benefit, that the profile can be used by other persons referring to you.
	What you are talking about isn't \"voice\", but a scene change.	I highly recommend reading related articles / forums in one of the many Role-Playing Games Communities.
3.60	We just addressed this recently, and the excellent answer suggested was guillemets.	guillemets, as suggested by Lauren Ipsum, is a good option.
	Try an experiment: take one aspect of that person's faith and go into ridiculous emotional detail.	I'll admit outright that it's late and so I won't read all of the rigorous Q&A presented here.
	The opening words of an essay should immediately enmesh the reader in your wiles.	When I express my thoughts online (and I have to make parenthetical statements) I love parentheses.
	Set up your world as a version of The Matrix.	Depending on your entire scenario, you have, I think, three options.
	Contact the local users group of the technology you've written about.	I tend to find technical books through recommendations on Hacker News.
	My advice would be to write your second novel, and then maybe even a third, before doing anything else.	In the last several months since this question was posted, e-books have surpassed hardback books in total sales volume.
	If you can find one, a Z88 might be a good choice.	You could go for a small Mac laptop and try finding one with AppleCare.
	Give him his own story so he's not stealing scenes in someone else's.	There's plenty of things you can do to make a character important to the plot.
	Why would you add extra anything if your plot doesn't need it?	I haven't read your story so I have no idea if it's boring or not.
	Matter of opinion and all that, but I prefer plain text with no formatting.	For longer pieces, especially those with figures, tables, contents, or internal references, or citations.
	You can jumble the characters of the existing species names.	Reading up on the effects of various Pyschoactive drugs might help.
	I'm interested to note that the users who expressed a preference went with the first version.	I have no problem with omniscient narrator viewpoint but the second example looks a little bit jerky.
	I think it largely depends on what kind of \"children's book\" we're talking about.	Actually, this is the only situation where run-on sentences should be used (and work better than short sentences).
3.00	The villains I absolutely hate are selfish and self-serving, but they are also cowards.	A villain you want to take down is, at his/her core, someone who does not care about the suffering of others.
	You need to have another good look at the structure of the novel.	I would suggest asking someone else to read it and see if there any parts you have not made clear.
	You are evidently aware of plagiarism and seem to consider it something that isn't right.	My experience has been lack of context and mystery most quickly grab my attention.
	I find the repetitive use of the same verb in a paragraph to be jarring.	Markdown is almost certainly the way to go for simple formatting.
	I have tried to write in XML and latex but neither seems very stream lined for fiction.	As mentioned above, I ended up developing my own tools and markup language to suit my needs.
1.20	You can write the book in any way you choose, as long as it works for you.	Sequence a only in writing (sometimes you have to go back and revise) option the not writer has is.
	This is an exceptionally difficult question to answer, because no-one actually knows the answer.	Are some people naturally gifted in writing, which means everyone else is doomed to mediocrity?
	It's a crutch if you don't make it solid enough to stand on it's own.	I know many people who started out writing fanfiction and then turned this into the basis of a professional career.
	Sometimes, parentheses can be vital to your essay (except when they're not).	Robusto has already discussed the way that the parentheses perform specific jobs.
	In the last several months since this question was posted, e-books have surpassed hardback books in total sales volume.	First Get some close friends, preferably a variety of types of people, to read it and give you feedback.
1.80	Yes, dull dialog should be removed completely (or transformed to interesting dialog).	I agree with Lauren's answer: You need highs and lows in any story.
	a good story/novel/book shouldn't have to have a \"suddenly\" to get surprise from the reader.	I think this is one of those areas where the 'show don't tell' rule really shines.
	Copyright laws tend to be similar everywhere, because most countries adhere to the Berne Convention.	I post a copyright notice on things I publish/blog on the Internet.
	I use OneNote and I think it's the best computer program ever happened.	I really like the idea of a small notebook, and I'd recommend that.
	I don't think 'actually' is particularly casual, and I agree with Dale Emery that the other words have different meanings.	The intention of the reviewer seems to be to avoid words that may reflect personal opinion.
	I would say it's perfectly possible to have an ensemble cast.	The recent Pulitzer winner A Visit from the Goon Squad is another example of a book like that.
	I go brainstorming by mapping out different scenes on a page, and trying to connect them.	The most reductionist view of a plot is: Equilibrium > Disturbance > Equilibrium.
	Aside from the grammar checker in MS Word, I can't really think of any.	If you want to use a subsidy publisher, I would just use common sense.
	Not a tablet, but a mini notebook sounds like it meets your size and battery life requirements.	The iPad is pretty good, but I would suggest getting a USB keyboard as well.
	Write it as if you're the one apologizing to them.	I think the best way to remind someone is \"I think my e-mail missed your attention\".
	NaNoWriMo Tens of thousands of lunatics collectively deciding to write an entire novel apiece in 30 days.	First, limit the number of people you solicit for feedback.
	Don't explain in detail how complicated it is, nor how to understand it.	Take a look at the work of Robert J. Sawyer and Terry Goodkind.
	Suggestion - stick to publically acessible facts, and express them as factual only in terms of the characters in your story.	I've been using Scrivener, which is available as a free beta for NaNoWriMo participants.
0.80	The answer to your question is: It depends on how the writer works.	At first, I thought this is a bit of a tricky question.
	There's a good essay by Malinda Lo on the process.	First thing you want to do is find a neutral beta reader.
	A good opening line gets the reader hooked and eager to read the next line.	My experience has been lack of context and mystery most quickly grab my attention.
	Fictionpress is a popular website that allows anyone to upload stories, read those stories, and comment.	I noticed you said \"movie critics\" enjoy mythological references in a film, but do audiences?
	I think your problem is procrastination, given that revising is no fun (imho).	You've got the seeds of your answer in your edit.
	Fastest and easiest to make the first couple bucks: Sell to your family and friends, get them to recommend them.	You can self-publish your book as an e-book using Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing, and it doesn't cost a penny.
	This is a bit like asking how long a piece of string should be.	The best way to write any novel (or story)is to write it as if it is a standalone.
	I agree with Lauren's answer: You need highs and lows in any story.	It's pretty readable as is (aside from a few grammatical errors in the dialogues that may be intentional) - not boring.
	If \"100k\" and \"50k\" are word-counts (and in this context, that's certainly what I'd expect), that's \"novella\" (for ~50k words) up to \"novel-length\" (at 100k words).	The standard initial market for a short story is a literary magazine.
1.20	Webster's New World Rhyming Dictionary: Clement Wood's Updated This is the rhyming dictionary I turn to first.	http://www.rhymezone.com/ You just type in a word, then select one of the following.
	Helping my 11 yr old son with a project last night, I noticed he was two-spacing it.	In short, this is a disagreement based on technological generations.
	Art is obsession, and how well (or badly) it's dealt with seems to fascinate artists.	Eudora Welty's One Wrtier's Beginnings weaves together in an absolutely lovely way the story of her journey as a writer.
	David Gerrold has always shied away from numbering chapters; he just puts in a section break and keeps writing.	Austerlitz by W. G. Sebald consists of a handful of paragraphs, each of 50 or so pages.
	Since this is deemed on topic, I'll give my recommendation as a proper answer.	I used to work on a project where we wrote a graphical UI to subversion for a group of artists.
	I use Subversion and Git as sort of a front end to Subversion.	If I'm writing something in a plaintext format, like LaTeX or HTML, I'll generally use version control.
	Sitting around a campfire discussing the highlights of the day's events is a good mechanism for character development during travel.	David Weber's The War God's Own has some lengthy travel scenes in it which he does quite well.
	Why should your description of a scene occur at an instant in time, like a photo?	Describe first whatever will pull the reader into the scene.
0.00	Keep in mind that you can easily swear without swearing.	I think Stephen King's comments are helpful in this regard.
	I have been doing a lot of my outlining/pre-writing work in Workflowy.	Not enough points to add to Lauren Ipsum's answer, but I really do like Scrivener.
	I am not a lawyer, my post comes from my experience working in the publishing world.	While an answer has already been selected, I wanted to add some further points.
	I found thinking about Scene/Sequel helpful in learning to avoid pointless scenes, both while revising and during outlining.	When I'm writing well, I don't think deliberately about MRUs.
	What happens in your story seems, from your description, to be action/thriller.	Just because a setting is made up doesn't mean it's fantasy.
	This question is crying for a link to the Sacred Cows of Publishing Killing.	Edit: Wikipedia knows how to explain it better than I do.
	Applying structure to prose is no more than good writing practice, after all, and not limited to blogs.	It depends on what your blog is trying to achieve.
3.20	In these days of googling, it's sloppy to not find the source of a quotation.	I agree with Kate Sherwood, you should be able to attribute most quotes these days by simple fact checking.
	It does feel weird when you're writing, but you don't notice it when you're reading.	Here's a technique that can help: Identify each instance of he saw or he heard or he thought.
0.20	I have been doing a lot of my outlining/pre-writing work in Workflowy.	Am I allowed to beat the drum for Scrivener again?
	Problem #1: There is no such thing as good and evil.	1) Does the story have to be from the POV of the necromancer?
	You're asking a good question, and if I may restate it: How do I write an effective business e-mail?	You can try a Business Writing textbook, looking through the most promising sections.
	I think what many archetype systems use as a base point (consciously or unconsciously) is the Enneagram of Personality.	I would suggest some of the pickup artist material that has been written over the past five years.
	Just be aware, why flashbacks are considered bad: Many people cannot follow them.	Call me boring, but, at least for now, I only disobey the chronological order for historical-based interludes.
	I would abbreviate your degrees; chances are your audience will understand them.	Rather than \"deployed\": helped to launch I've no idea what an \"enterprise application\" is, so perhaps that could be rephrased.
	The main reason this doesn't grab my attention is that there is no sense of immediacy.	Christopher Vogler's summary of Joseph Campbell's Monomyth, \"A Practical Guide to The Hero With a Thousand Faces\".

0.00	we seem to have lost sight of the meaning of the whole thing...is	he was the first speaker of the house in history to be fined.
	our nation as (they?)	how long ago was this?

	for me, natural labor was quick and easy.	i'm an adult, and a wife and a mum.
	there is no such thing as u.s. english.	there's more to life than a couple of men.
	@patiodog, (i've shared this story before so please forgive the rerun...)	so ask yourself \"do i deserve this for the rest of my life or do i deserve better?\"...i
	i am now overpaying a bit and have 8.5 years left and can visibly see it reducing every time i log on to my online account.	i am wary about doing this as i am unable to find the letter that agreed to me letting out my flat.
	the next problem is that this world police has issued arms ownership licenses so liberally that the world police does not control the world territory.	the problem is, that i don't really have a life plan but i am the sort of person who likes to have things fairly planned out.
	they live in england and should speek english!	what does keeping england english even mean?
	they screwed the pooch on this story.	so that is the end of that.
	it was bloody hard work and working for free to gain experience is a good thing.	i'm not very dogmatic about too many things, but i firmly believe young teens having sex is not a good thing.
	and of all that only the maintenance and perhaps the engineering is generally us provided.	i just wanted to say that in my experience the fear of the unknown is the worst thing.
0.20	lots of luck, she will get through this phase!	also, assuming the whole thing is a sham..
	didn't figure in the interest that'll be due on it, did you?	i don't know of anywhere in the us where there's actual abject poverty.
2.00	i'd love to tear apart his lies, but i don't know how good i'd be on a radio show.	thanks for thinking of me, but i don't have the desire to appear on his show.

	*drool* she may be a socialist, but at least she's a hot one!	edgar, you may be right - at least in part.
	all those things you mention are the twisted twine ball of the government.	i most certainly did not treat the disaster as if it doesn't exist.
	you speed walk in your sleep.	depending on you sex.
	it's a tough call even for states, because of what i said in the first paragraph.	it's a tough call, but today's minimum is too low.

	so i was living at a homeless tent city called camp take notice in ann arbor and i was living in a tent with the man i was in a relationship with.	so the night before thanksgiving she asked me if i was still making the pie and i told her yes, i was going to make it from scratch with suger pumpkins i grew in my garden.
	wtf is that all about?	how old is that program?
	by the way, the truth of the super committee negotiations is that the democrats didn't off one single plan.	i'd say the precedent was set when the democrats gave clinton a pass for lying under oath.
	england remains a world power, the rest degenerating under the yoke of socialism.	and i would appreciate armed strangers not trying to manage my own personal safety.
	if your problem is with the banks,then sue the banks and try to get some money out of them.	your claim that he has killed 3 times as many al qeada is completely false.
	my sister is getting ready to go to uni and i really am starting to resent him for how my life is now.	my sister is two years younger than i am, and i remember the day she came home from the hospital.
	i have no problem with that.	we are at war with al-qaida.
0.00	reality, of course, disagrees.	totally free of course.

	contrary to the persistent vomiting of 24hr news networks, the news doesn't really change as often as their advertisers would have you believe.	quote: the existence of 2 (presumably) youngish children would suggest that the marriage is not the cold and unrewarding one the husband would have you believe.
	you cannot continue to 'be her friend' out of pity, and tbh you are not being true to yourself if you feel like this and then invite her places.	if it continues to be a problem i'd start showing your daily sheet to the director before you leave - let her see that mrs. i hasn't changed a diaper in 3 hours.
	the fact that nixon and carter were uxorious did not make them good presidents.	that this message is deserved is not the point.

3.20	to suggest that blacks are not poor due to external factors leaves black disproportionate poverty to be the result of internal factors, which could only mean that blacks are inferior.	to suggest that social and economic gaps are internal to blacks is to suggest that there is a genetic propensity that makes blacks inferior.
	i would certainly label him a narcissist or a psychopath.	this would be an interesting story to keep up with.
	for the most part, i think the market should be allowed to set it's own price, but would agree that there does have to be a minimum wage of some kind.	he's an adult. he should be courteous to your home and keep it clean, but outside of that he should be able to come and go as he pleases.
	at least he didn't choose to carry a great big gun that killed his target, who was not committing any capital crime.	more often than not ows protestors are targeting their peers on the street rather than anyone who has committed any actual wrong doing.
	he still has a job becuase the city was unaffected...but he lost his home.	this thing has gone just exactly as the democrats hoped.
	this person is only going to get worse - not better.	there was nobody waiting for me to come home.
	wow that vor person is a idiot!	would that be legal in this country?
	oh spare us all this nonsense you keep pulling out of your ass.	just say you would like help in working out access for your son.
	there are times, especially when we are pregnant, that we have to prioritize.	i believe the pals and israelis are fast getting to that point.
	and tell them if they cannot wait how to protect themselves.	sue them and try to get some money out of them.
	they are merely retaliating to whatever our politicians throw at them!	they are sitting on over a trillion dollars in cash.
	is no consideration to be given to the crim?	why is no one sanctioning the us??
	but they have new truck every year, a huge custom and all their kids dive nice cars and go to state collages.	but whatever happens, we need some national truth-telling, and we need to stop calling \"them\" the problem.
	or maybe just a commutation of sentence like for scooter libby.	it may be a question of magnitude once again.
	wanted to know if a bracelet i had listed at $14.50 was sterling silver.	and now it appears that there was a second one, that is now being uncovered.
	police are convinced that there are people who know something, but no one has come forward with any information.	and if we continue to be a nation that allows sex with anyone, any time with anyone.
	i'm sure that idea will win great support amongst the populous.	but i'm sorry to say i don't really take the ndp seriously.
	it was my stepdad that had said \"so and so died of a broken heart\" and i would laugh.	hi, since bout a year after i started secondary school i've been getting this shoulder pain.
	i clicked on everything and couldn't find a link.	timing is everything and this is not a good thing in the long run omho.
	my bother, aunt, uncle and mysteriously this old women that was also involved in my court case.	not a single word said about the idiocy of someone that poor thinking about mating.
	new zealand beer is also acceptable, as new zealand is pound for pound the greatest sporting nation on earth and it can only be due to the beer.	we know the date this happened, because we know when mom and sister came home from the hospital, so i was two years and two months old at the time.
	some refused to go because they didn't want to be killed.	the rioters are pretty focused on the police and the president.
1.80	i agree with you about 'shouting about being different', what do you count as proclaiming difference?	i agree with you, quantum windbag, and so do most legal commentators i have read.
2.60	the international development secretary, hilary benn, the former health secretary alan milburn, and the leader of the commons, jack straw, are all at 25/1.	the foreign secretary, margaret beckett, is at 40/1, while the defence secretary, des browne, and the welsh and northern ireland secretary, peter hain are 50/1.
	* stop giving money belonging to we the people, away to the corrupt politicians of foreign governments.	it sounds horrible but feeding these people is the worst thing you can do in the long run.
	the way the system is designed, not much more than this is practically possible.	the father is not a public figure and is a private citizen.
	i don't know what to make of the whole thing to be honest..	i can't see his death reducing the scale of the 'war on terror'..
	but when it came to what i questioned?	to want to know he is safe ?
	so i have been looking around for somewhere else.	(i have been in full time employment for 25 years).
3.00	don't you follow, and want our laws to follow all of leviticus?	she's on line here but hasn't answered as to whether or not she follows all of leviticus, and whether or not she want's our nation's laws to follow all of leviticus.
0.70	in fact, watching fox will tell you the exact opposite of what you are claiming.	try dealing with the facts instead of your wishful thinking.
	it is looking bad for ray right now.	meets dr. king; asks him for a job.
	i never had any luck with the temp agencies, one time i got a voice mail from one of them saying they had a job for me.	if they have made peace with their pay, then there is no reason you should not be at peace with their pay as well.
	always easy to blame others for your ineptitude.	they are with us for our lifetimes and beyond.
1.20	thus the need for health care insurance reform...the	is your health care rationed?
	does this sound fair?would the kids be happier with two fathers who love them than a man and woman where only one parent really loves them?	i think it would have helped me draw a line between the traumatic events of her death and funeral and marked the start of my learning to deal with life without mum.
	into actually rebuilding the country.	i dont have any dog in the fight.
	crony capitalism has been on the fore front of political debate for at least a few years now.	it's whether or not political rhetoric can cause people to do violence.
3.40	and of course it not ever their fault, as it's now fox news, the righties, blaa blaa blaa.	now of course its everyones fault but their own.
	now the space-shuttle program is going tits up thanks to him so we're pretty much out of the space business.	hope your little one is coping ok with the stress (although in this situation i bet the kids are much better than the parents).
	false it is down 11%.	i would also not back down.
	she is so sensitive that even if i don;t eat dinner she gets in a mood and takes it personally!	there's two entities that have zero interest in keeping obama in the white house.
	we didn't really get anywhere so he dropped me home and told me to go and that it would be a 50 50 decision to split.	now - they are dangerous - cos they would move to another bottle, and it would all begin again.
	i was in and out of the wards, civilian and va 2 or 3 times a year from 96 to 2000.	william hill have cut the odds on the prime minister leaving this year from 5/1 to 9/4.
	after college i, like many others at the time, felt a compulsion to change what we saw as inequalities in the world and became a social worker.	i saw her all the time and we spoke about 6 times a day on the phone up until she was very ill in her last weeks and sleepy with morphine.
	i asked if they had showed him the time as he needs visual prompts and she said 'i told him he had 10 minutes' i asked if she showed him 10 minutes and she said no.	he invited me in the past (while simultaneously saying i should be tried and executed), and i told him that i believe he is mentally ill and needs help, not attention.
	usually, there is only 1 us at 20 weeks with my midwife unless there are other circumstances.	unfortunately they're going to end up at the same address six feet under - they be pals or israelis.
	it's the biggest, hottest news story in media.	yes, the conventional media.
1.60	you can claim it's false all you want, but facts are facts.	you spew here what you claim to be facts.
1.60	most christians do not hate gay's, they hate the sin.	but as a christian, i believe what god's word tells me.
	all politics aside, it was the most important issue on the ballot as far as i was concerned.	have a quiet registry marriage with just the important people there, followed by a party for everyone done cheaply.
	you think this whole thread is conspiracy theory bs?	why do you think that commandment is there?
0.80	or like oil companies, who have a cartel.	true oil only comes from quart sized cans.
	that is exactly what happened: no, it isn't, unless you believe that the instant vaporization of hundreds of thousands of people can be written off because of their nationality.	they report that there are no planes coming in or out, and that there are tens of thousands of people at the airport.
	again, you daft cunt, i'm not rich and i get great health coverage.	i wouldnt be able to change to a buy to let mortgage.
2.00	i wrote in my journal that it felt like i had a leather mask on my head.	i wrote that it felt like someone smashed a champagne bottle on the back of my head like it was a departing ship.
	\"for over 20 years, i have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week.	for the first 1-2 years he hated me going out with my friends.
	should we be talking to someone about this?	wtf are you talking about?
	common sense tells us that bankers that have to sell their third vacation home are the one's with entitlement issues.	however my cash flow is better with them then without since the rental income more than covers the mortgages on them plus...
2.00	i don't actually give two figs what minimum wage does for or against the economy.	the idea of regular increments to minimum wage is a good one - for businesses to cope with them.
	thank god for the 99%ers' they seem to understand the system is rigged.	then i found others that countered what she said.
	so it is a big deal that they are coming.	so now it is a fight for freedom of choice.
1.60	the tea party didn't promote ending the intereference of religion in politics.	in this case it is the freedom of choice vs. the freedom of religion.
	there, now, isn't that more literate than 'lying racist'...	therefore, it was christians that did it!\"
	you must have seen zona's post on the other thread.	you wouldn't have an original thought if it hit you in the face.

	i believe this man gets it.	if they dont want to.
	he is an ex-ecb vice president.	this was an accident...
	the detective in charge hasn't answered phone calls and his bag hasn't been returned to him, which contained business papers and clothes.	the deficit is a result of borrowing to save the collapse of the banking system, not because labour invested too much money into our services.
	pakistani military, isi or the nwo order?	as we stand there is no will that we know of anywhere.
	the lawmakers choice to bail out the banks is an entirely separate issue of accountability.	what the police have to find out now is if zimmerman instigated the confrontation.
	bloodletting is not a valid medical treatment, either.	the father is not a public figure and is a private citizen.
	i think the lakotas never expected to win in court..ray	i'm shocked he was even elected...
	seems to me you would want them to make money in order to have money in order to clean up this mess..	also, penn state fans are being encouraged to wear white to the next game in order to protest the persecution of paterno and express their support.
	i curse worse than a sailor so i felt it was best to think about those choice words for her.	oil is washing up north of miamui beach on the east side of florida.
	who said zimmerman is a victim?	wow that vor person is a idiot!
2.20	the rich don't need cobra, they can buy their own individual policy at any price...so	the poor don't need cobra to continue being insured, they never were insured by their employers, they have medicaid.
	this development is interesting because it raises a lot of fascinating questions about economic management.	and i don't even engage in the practice of being \"vague\" about the description of my inventory.
2.40	how will conservatives respond to the issues?	but conserv won't address these issues.
	exactly how awesome are you, anyway?	just what are you reading?
	do we want iran to become the next north korea?	all of that proves that zimmerman told the police the truth.
	it's a human endeavor.	and that's a tall order.
0.00	ground/home deliver tues thru sat...	they didn't even have a train station...
2.20	a recent example is how a federal court rejected a lawsuit based on \"national security.\"	upon his release he sued the us for the above crimes and the case was dismissed for \"national security reasons.\"
1.00	my mum married the other man and stayed with him until he died.	my dad met a lovely woman and also remarried.
	it make sense to at least release one proper picture of bin laden too to silence all the critics?	and our population hasn't increased by over a factor of 10 in the last two generations.
	i agreed to marry him.	you will learn to make real chips.
	its hard to understand why the brits would desire to be assimilated into the eu.	i think there are numerous instances where our justice system is simply too punitive.
	people who design the robots.	perhaps we knew each other.
	they leave that pathetic shite to cnn & nbc.	other than that, i'm afraid there's not much else you can do.
	:/ after reading through the posts in this thread, isn't the main issue one where british nationals are being denied the right to come here.	leviticus 18:24, 30 reads, \"defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which i cast out before you.

	i have a brother and sister that do not speak to me and they think this was a brilliant way to get back at me (believe it or not!!).	i am sure the counsellors there have seen so many manipulators and the fallout that they may be able to suggest strategies to cope.
	the politics of congress).	that is how it works.
	who said anything about the csi program, genius.	i have family waiting in the cairo airport right now.
	why do you think that commandment is there?	why do wingnuts hate intelligence?
	i think this is a political not current event thread.	i wouldn't say it's racist, just insular great thread.
	president bush became the first president to spend 3 percent of gdp on federal antipoverty programs.	some members of the president's staff were indited and sent to prison for perjury and other offenses.
	it seems like every time something goes on between my husband and i that his friends have to get involved or make rude comments.	it seems like the best option would have been something like \"hey, i think this violin is fake and paypal is saying i have to destroy it to get my money back.
	it may destabilize the gulf for a while, but in the long run it will prove to be fruitful.	if the government provides health care, whether spelled out in this bill or not, it will ration the care.
0.00	our justice system is rotten to the core, so what are we going to do about it?	do you think she just told you not to bother because you just had a baby not to long ago?
	if you want to learn absolutely nothing, whilst watching the poor old teacher trying to play a role that largely consists of being a jail warden, then go to a comprehensive.	if you want to change society's morals you appeal to the hearts and minds of the people that are willing to listen and if they embrace it what you find to be immoral will eventually die out on it's own.
	i don't need you to state whether you've excused it or not, by your actions its clear that you have.	i don't mean to be dense, but why do you have to find out what his long term intentions are?

	she actually asked me if i had a can of pumpkin for back up.	she acts like she had no idea who she was praising.
3.00	this has been so usual for us that i can bring her home and not change her again til 6:30 or 7 and her diaper is still peed in but not full at all.	whenever we pick her up from all but one of the teachers, her sheet says she was changed at 4:30ish and when i change her again at 6:30 or 7 her diaper is fine.
	(this is in primary by the way).	i didnt do as well at stanford, by the way.

1.60	in actual practise, the clinics tend to keep the embryos on ice because they fear law suits.	in their view, there is a difference between an embryo and a brain dead person.

	i know when the only solution is to spend trillions for minimal, unproven benefit, i know the liar is a leftist.	however, i might try to find someone with the means and skills to investigate the position because i do think it has merit.
3.40	so if the jury was in fact instructed incorrectly, chances are they will not come to the correct conclusion.	the jury is to be instructed as to the law to be applied to the facts they determine, not the other way around.
	the problem i have here is that the wbc's site isn't a memorial site for matthew snyder, it is their own property to disseminate their point of view.	however, there is no drama that he was involved with anna chapman or any other honey pot involved with russian or us mafias.
	the former home secretary charles clarke is the outsider at 66/1.	the nurse needs a scientific calculator to take your pulse.

	what are scientists who are educated in how to treat and prevent the problem going to do?	but there is nothing that you are willing to do that will rectify the problem.
	i think there is a broader view of holding people accountable that your conveniently ignore with your argument.	i think there are a number of high-profile crimes where criminals are held long long after the point where they are a danger to anyone.
	three of the seals being rescued were also killed and the fourth wounded.	even our r&d is being jobbed-out to faraway india and other parts of the world.
0.00	it gives me just as good a reason never to use ebay.	just how good a basis is revenge for sentencing?
	as unions usually do, they chose keeping their benefits at the level they are, over keeping cops on the job, and the lay offs happened.	unions are for those that have no other skill other than a 5th grade educated worker has with a hammer in their hand.
2.20	i really dont know what to do...	i don't really know what is up but i'm super mad about it.
	it's kind of scary but the thing is he wants to be caught, he's just making people work to catch him.	it is a national campaign that wants people to stop snitchin' on people who commit crimes.

	the conversation turned to politics, which led eventually to a rather silly looking woman (rslw) saying that she hated the bnp.	the verses above from leviticus are in a section of the bible that lists immoral acts and the penalties for them.
	wher the women even those pregnant were not allowed any breaks except a 30 minute lunch perid.	we then gave our insurance company the crime ref number and the receipts of the items stolen.

	the high court declared the case against the machines moot since the justice department has now cleared the machines, and ordered another part back to court to decide a fight over attorney fees.	both sides could have used better attorneys on this, the arguments dance around the real issues and ignore the facts - on both sides.

	it exists on the other end of the spectrum.	what is even more bothersome to me personally...
	if she cant communicate then her familywould be free to do what they wanted with her without getting found out.	he told the the administration what they wanted to hear.
	you can take a picture of yourself from ten feet away without using the timer.	but the fact is, you idiots fired her before anyone knew about the story.
	but man are a lot of middle class and even poor americans brainwashed.	there's also a side issue of amicus waivers.
	i don't spend my days surfing for news bytes to find something to bitch about.	i don't mean for president; i mean out of the country.
	care i think sinatra unsubscribed from his own thread.	i have seen the streams run as black slurries from strip mining.
	for example, it's okay for you to impose your value, because you are special?	you're better off without him in your life, and you'll have a life.
	and when that happens, it hurts the feelings of our troops.	and what happened to that lie you were going to cite in cristol's book?
	i lost my mum and i felt the same way, for quite a long time, so i think i understand how it is for you.	was worth just over £10k at the time with only 7,000 miles on the clock i think and i got it for £6,200.

	tens of thousands of americans!	and this was of particular interest.
	they offered up private solutions, good ones, ones that don't increase taxes on anyone.	neither government nor people should impose their values on anyone.
	i think it's a real shame on the part of our government for treating them like this.	i think this is what the original starter of the thread (joshw) is driving at.
	aig gets bailed out, then gives multi-million dollar bonuses in the very same year.	here is a partial list: - the stimulus has created millions of jobs in the private sector.
	in russia, 56% positively evaluate the work of obama.	i am positively surprised about this choice.
	this, had we be wiling to talk about it seriously at the time, would have been legitimate cause for concern.	had that been on the 5.30pm from victoria it would have been a goner.
	they might be hiding him or something, in which case what is the problem?	i said i complain the 3 or so times a month i ring with the same problem.
	at least that is my hope.	@edgarblythe, that is very sad.
4.60	why didn't we ever hear about it during the bush admin when during his admin the national debt was more than doubled?	but they never mentioned the doubling of the national debt under the bush admin.
	it's one thing if you are just lazy and forget, but its another thing to lie about diaper changes all together.	i am wrong about the unemployment rate, but every other point i made about obama is true.

	hiya all -long posting alert!!!!	why all the lying about this on your part?
	while i'm sure mr schlesinger enjoyed taking a swipe at the departed mr bush, he adds nothing to the debate.	the story that a soldier related to larry king about how he died is now known to be a false.

	(funny - we all looked forward to the occasional divert to da nang with its hooches and booze.)	none of them conformed to the conditions set out and agreed to by the allies.
1.60	i went to see another male friend last night who i know has a thing for me, and he started hitting on me and i let him have sex with me, until i realised i couldn't do it and stopped and made him take me home.	but for some reason this morning when i was asking if he had fun, and what they did etc. i asked if it was an all nude or just a topless and i should not have asked that. he told me all nude and i just broke down crying.
	there's no such thing as arguing for peace rather than a the continuation of a morbid death cult.	these sanctions in place will not harm the iranians intention to build nuclear weapons..
	less cops - more murder and rapes.	ask for the crime number and see.
	know we would love our own house but i can't save anything until the end of my dmp.	yet he doesn't seem to have anything better to offer.
	in this case i think that is beyond ceasar's bounds.	no it's just that people like you can't be honest.
	nothing that i have read in this interaction leads me to believe anyone is exaggerating except maybe you.	you might also try posting on the benefits board here to see if anyone can suggest any routes for you.
	he's recently changed policy to go after the iranian agents that are supplying the militias.	i was recently thinking i should know more about the sudan, as well as syria.
	i have had two periods of counselling in my life, over roughly 15 months from december 2009 until around march this year.	i haven't had airconditioning my whole life until a couple of months ago, and now i have a \"swamp cooler\".
	really stinks at it was just our anniversary right before.	i have family waiting in the cairo airport right now.
	as a general question, i would like to ask others to see what you think?	again i would like to know where you are getting this bullcrap from, rat.
1.80	you've worn out your third pair of tennis shoes this week.	you've worn out the handle on your favorite mug.
	are you going for effort or result?	what is going on there?
	last night, defence confirmed it was aware of the report and was seeking more information.	because it isn't about \"life\", it's about punishing the harlots and making women incubators.
	the fact is, the tax cut/rebate he gave both times put money into mostly the lower to middle class folks.	the fact is we were burgled and these items were stolen.
	how does that change the fact i'm breathing oil fumes right now?	i am just a big ball of hormones right now.
	but what is this anger going to get you.	that's why i can no longer support them.
	unfortunately they're going to end up at the same address six feet under - they be pals or israelis.	as you know, recently my mother died, and she named me and my sister as the executors of her will.
1.40	waiting in an outer hall, i stood to the side as my boss conversed with someone.	as the only white in the hall, i understood why the question was being asked.
	it was many other portions of your thesis that were in question.	i say the time to tackle the iran issue is now.
	why does it matter that he's black?	so does the us a lot more too, whats the difference??
	also, finding out what it was all about the hard way.	all thsoe things are fine and dandy, but not what the thread is about.
	we should abolish medicare and the va.	they should just amend the house rules...stop
	i'll pay back the loans for the education i received, i have no issues with that.	really has nothing to do with what i said, but let's look at that.
1.60	who in the media's been going \"half-cocked\" and how did they do it?	why has no one come forward to admit the truth?
	you say youre living at home with your parents.	you just have to think what you want, it may seem tough on others.
	i don't really know what is up but i'm super mad about it.	i'll check them out while i'm out and about tomorrow.
	so the big fish stays big and little guppies cant have shit.	i saw the bits of cereal floating around in the milk and threw the glass across the kitchen.
	i felt so terrible that i went insane on my thighs and cut them to bits because i can't bear for anyone else to see them ever again.	i agree with the others, it is better to say everything, and let them edit it themselves, they will pick the relevant information out, that is their job.
	it is all about demanding those taxpayer freebies.	it is still happening: it will not stop happening for 100 years.
2.80	thai thaksin supporters plan largest rally since april riots june 27 (bloomberg) -- thai anti-government protesters who support former prime minister thaksin shinawatra plan to meet in bangkok today in what organizers say will be the largest rally since the army quelled riots by the group in april.	thaksin \"red shirts\" gather again in bangkok bangkok, april 25 (reuters) - about 3,000 supporters of exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra gathered in bangkok on saturday for their first rally in the capital since violent street clashes two weeks ago.
2.00	when you open your dish cabinet, and there is only mugs.	you've worn out the handle on your favorite mug.
1.60	why hasn't the us government done that (if the affair is fake, taht is..)	i think it's a real shame on the part of our government for treating them like this.
0.00	the word threat or threaten was never once spoken by obama.	they found the bomb before they found the woman.
	you think a trillion dollars is puny?	don't you think we deserve to know more about this man?
	as a weak country with no big weapons to defend its people..	the whole country is a toxic cesspool of pollution.
	if the idea of 9/11 complicity is ever to be taken seriously by the masses, people must stop buying into obvious hoaxes and disinformation and focus solely on the true facts.	one of the voices of protest i fondly listened to belonged to ed sanders - yeah, the gross poet wanna be who sang dirty songs as the leader of the fugs.
	it wasn't always easy but it has enriched my son's life no end.	it was all the more startling because it was not perceived by people who'd always lived here.
0.20	the separation of the roles of priest and healer of the body started in recent times and in relatively small geocultural areas.	the leaders of the world need to get together and begin constructing a massive plan to stop global warming.
	they have not implemented the social stories as advised by the speech therapist so this could have helped him understand.	i have not read what she said beyond this site nor do i care what she said.
3.80	rupert murdoch inherited his father's ownership of two newspapers in the u.k. (australia).	murdoch inherited two fairly successful newspapers and turned them into a global media empire.
	moveon, dailykos, msnbc & the dems have a lot more, thanks to a friendly hungarian.	a man, walking his dog, tells the driver that was pulled over, that he saw him stop at the sign.
0.40	edgar, you may be right - at least in part.	the problem is, you are going after people just like you.
	they havent raised any moral issues or issues of any kind with having to provide contraception at no additional cost.	i have tried to give a full picture of what happened during this time including conversations i had and telephone conversations.
	about the unemployment bill?	could the protests turn violent?
	i had planned none of this, so i had little to share.	japan under the army had no intention of surrender.
	i used to watch these guys when i ran the texas rangers ball club.	i refuse to argue jesse jackson on this or any other thread.
	how about some of your own medicine.	how original of you tm.
3.00	wednesday’s decision is likely to please turkey, which has warned that the bill, if enacted, would seriously affect turkish-french ties.	the french legislation has enraged turkey, which has threatened sanctions if french president nicolas sarkozy signs the bill.
	does not have the vision or the courage to sustain a program like apollo.	the net result would be devastating to the poorest of the poor.
0.60	suicide rates are sky high indicting desperation and sadness.	i can hear the desperation in your words.
	people who believe that it is a cover up also think the movie \"independence day\" is a documentary.	i don't believe they have even started the bacs transfer, although the money is out of my account.
	i have tough skin and a suspicious heart.	i have no idea what party/pres.
	the link would have provided you with another aid too...	and tbh - once you do have kids - you will feel even more trapped.
	they think that the stop snitchin' campaign has something to do with it.	i think newt has been the most accurate and forthright.
	seeing a pattern here yet?	seeing mutated corpses don't bother me.
	guess, what the lower middle to middle class already cannot afford it.	guess what dipshit - oil fumes are no laughing matter.
	also i dont see thre being white majority groups in those countries, if anything they are getting smaller.	i don't need to create problems for myself, with customers feeling they were mislead.
	pedorathist that trained me are from texas and trained at the austin, texas location.	i happened to cross this thread, however, and just wanted to clear up a couple of things.
	\"it is getting hotter, and the icecaps are melting and there is a buildup of carbon dioxide in the air.\"	it is more honest and accurate to say receipts average between 17%-19%, and in the 90's were in the high 19s and hit 20 by the end.
	historically there has been hundreds of millions murdered in the name of islam across the world, every year there are hundreds of thousands murdered in the name of islam.	they report that there are no planes coming in or out, and that there are tens of thousands of people at the airport.
	so - if they are at little risk of re-offending - what do we do?	just when was that little bit of legislation signed into law?
	you have a crystal ball?	does anyone have any advice?
0.60	is your health care rationed?	is there any property involved?
	thousands were literally bawling at his funeral.	that's why i'm talking about this.
	a fair enough question, since i was the only white one on board.	and i care enough about each of you to share with you god's truth.
	it was really weird to see such a thing on fox.	it may not be the case, but it's something to think about.
0.00	we are the home of tesla motors that only the \"sean penns\" of the world can afford.	when we were young, before my husband got an easier job, he did manual labor.
	the era that the book covers is the worst era in tory party history so there is bound to be a lot of criticism in there but he is not slagging off the conservative party.	most americans are just to dumb to realize that their way of life is going to be changing for the worse and we are barely seeing the results of their apathy.
0.60	that darn liberal media never goes after liberals!!!	that is what liberty is about, after all.
	and there will not be any stain on that money abetting abortions.	and then he gets his money back for it not being authentic?
0.80	allowing them to set up camp, much like they did in afghanistan to launch attacks accross the world?	we have shed thousands of lives in iraq and afghanistan and what have we accomplished?
	i know that bothers you socialists/progressives, but that's the way it is.	i think that proably our biggest problem is that that is very rarely true.
	we will be a third world country before you know it.	we were a country of innovation!
	sure as hell doesn't sound safer to me.	mushy has to be the odds on favorite.
	i can't wait for delivery day!	i can spot em a mile away.
	i suggest you spread yourself out.	i understand your thinking.
	because he isn't a leader, he is a perpetual campaigner and chief.	because it's fun, and there are no consequences.
	other than that, i'm afraid there's not much else you can do.	either way, if you fancy a chat, feel free to pm if i were you id focus on an idol.
1.60	the obama administration?	the resolution was opposed by the obama administration.
	the prime minister is also 14/1 to stay on long enough to beat margaret thatcher's 11-year spell.	he served three years in lock up, now he is on one year house arrest and ten years probation.
	still trying to believe that the world is a zero sum game?	the rest of the world knows the same.
	but it hurt 100x worse.	but look at the other side.
	so far great shoe even though they cost so much.	i agree with there goes trouble.
	this was an accident...	this is totally unacceptable!
	i am heart sorry for you.	it's not healthy for our nation.
	a lot of this revolves around money (or lack of), weddings = money, children = money and houses = money.	i thought this would be a good time for a meeting thread to exchange information and to remenisce.
	why would they go to war over an ideology?	what have they done to deserve this?
	your exclusionary club of bigotry is about to be infiltrated.	your life's goal is to amount to a hill of beans.
	he knew that even though it wasn't his fault he was in trouble.	it may not have been common, but it doesn't have to be a long process.
	wtf are you babbling about?	are you just in denial?
	returned with great quality and a great representation of our firm.	this is why homosexuality is a great harm to our society.
	government or the guys that actually own the business?	coming from the west isn't usually too terrible.
	and they would try and put people together with volunteer opportunities.	and it got there without any of the vitriol of the ows.
	it was our day, how we wanted and it was wonderful.	it displaces more water than an aircraft carrier.
	he insisted one of the workers at the dmv give him one and she turned him down and got fired because of that.	one other thing, the reason why most like me think private enterprise is the only way to go now is because our govt.
	i don't care if my 10-year old boy plays hours and hours of gta (ok, maybe not too much).	we decided that i would get my scissors and cut off his extra meat ( i think we played doctor too much).
	everything's fair game on a public board.	this i am managing -just about.
